          <SubHeading />
          <LanguageSets />
          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Animals, birds, snakes, insects, and other creatures are mentioned very frequently in the Bible, especially in the poetic books of Job and Psalms, and in many of the prophets. This is to be expected, since the people of Israel lived in an environment that had not been modified to any great extent by man, and the hunters among them, hunting with their simple weapons, had not reduced animal populations significantly. A certain amount of woodland was cut down for human use or burnt to create grazing land, but this would not have been very extensive. For century after century the environment would have been left virtually in its natural state.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Even in their major cities the Hebrew people were surrounded by birds, lizards, and insects, and they did not need to venture very far afield before they were among wild animals. There were herds of gazelles and antelope grazing and browsing freely in the open plains, with deer and wild pigs in the more wooded areas. In the rockier mountain areas there were ibexes and wild mountain sheep. These city dwellers also had livestock of their own, feeding in the pastures around the city, cared for by family members or hired herdsmen. They would thus all have been very familiar with the habits and behavior of both the domestic and the wild creatures.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The land in those days had, and still has, a large number of bird species, some of which were resident, while others were migrants. Many species of bird from Central Asia and Europe fly to Africa at the beginning of the northern winter. In order to avoid flying long distances over the Mediterranean Sea or the Indian Ocean, they take a land route that passes over Israel. Thus there are literally millions of birds that pass over every year, going south between late September and early November, and returning north in March and April. There are probably more migrating birds passing over Israel than any other country on earth, since this is the only place in the world where three continents meet. Many of them stay for a few weeks in Israel, regaining their strength before they move on again. As a result they are well known to the local people. This would have been true also in biblical times.</Paragraph>

          <Heading><b>Identifying the Biblical Animals and Birds</b></Heading>
          <SubHeading />
          <LanguageSets />
          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Translating the Hebrew and Greek names of the animals and birds of the Bible is very difficult. There is doubt about the meaning of many of the animal names. Even greater doubt exists about the meaning of most bird names, as can be seen from a comparison of Bible translations. It is rare indeed that they will agree or that the same bird name will be translated the same way each time.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the light of this problem, the author of this Handbook has tried to apply a uniform methodology for each section of the book. First, there has been a study of archaeological and other evidence, and a careful attempt has been made to ascertain which animals, birds, and other creatures are most likely to have been found in Egypt and the land of Israel in biblical times. Then, on the basis of the biblical contexts in which the creature’s name occurs, and in the light of what is known about the meaning of the verb root from which the name is derived, an attempt has been made to match the most likely creature with the given contexts.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The results of this method should not be taken as the last word on the subject but should be seen as either a) support for one or more existing translations, or b) yet another plausible option from which to choose.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In addition to the above problems, a further problem is that the English names for some of the birds differ from place to place. For example, the eagle known in books published in Britain, Israel, and East Africa as the short-toed eagle is known as the black-breasted snake-eagle in books published in the U.S.A. and southern Africa. For this reason the scientific names are also given along with the popular names. Occasionally there are even alternate scientific names, and in these cases both are given. The scientific names are used universally in bird books, regardless of the language of publication.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="fauna-table-classification_en"/>Zoologists use a universally accepted system of classifying animals. This handbook makes frequent use of terms in this classification system. In some places, where scientific precision is not a factor, other terms such as “types” or “varieties” may appear. The following is a table of major classification categories, or ranks, in descending order of size. Ranks appearing in BOLD TYPEFACE are defined in the glossary.</Paragraph>

          <Heading><b>Translating the Words for the Biblical Creatures</b></Heading>
          <SubHeading />
          <LanguageSets />
          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Translators are advised to obtain the best available field guides for the animals and birds of their area; from this they should try to find the nearest local equivalents. Even where these books are in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or German, the pictures, the descriptions, and the scientific names will help to identify the animals or birds, and then the vernacular name, if any, can be found. In some field guides in Africa, such as the excellent <i>Roberts’ Birds of Southern Africa</i>, an attempt has been made to provide some of the names in local languages. These vernacular names should be carefully checked on the basis of the pictures and descriptions, and the translators should find out what most people in the language community call the birds. It is likely that there are often regional differences in the vocabulary for birds.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Finding a local equivalent will in many cases be difficult for translators in the Americas, the Far East, and Australasia, especially for the birds, since most of the biblical birds are either found only in the lands of the Bible, or they migrate between Europe or Central Asia and Africa but are not found further afield. The translator will always have the following options:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. Translate the biblical word with the local word for the same creature.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. Translate the biblical word with the local word for the most similar local creature, paying attention to the special symbolic importance the biblical or local animal may have.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. Translate the word for a specific animal with a more generic word. Thus, for instance, where bears are not known, an expression like “a big fierce animal” with a footnote could substitute in some contexts.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>4. Translate the biblical word with a word borrowed from a well-known trade or international language that refers to the biblical creature, and include a description of the creature in a glossary or short dictionary at the end of your Bible.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Of these options the first one is the best solution, but it will only be possible, of course, where the animal mentioned in the Bible is well known locally. Even in these cases, however, the translator needs to be careful, especially where the animal is referred to in the Bible in a figurative expression or metaphor. The significance in the biblical culture may be very different from its significance in the local culture. As an example, to the Hebrew writers the hyena signified death, ruin, and the desolation that results from being utterly defeated in war. But in some African cultures the hyena is associated with witches. In these cultures to say “Your land will become the dwelling place of hyenas” implies that your land will be taken over by witches. This is not the implication intended by a Hebrew writer using exactly the same expression.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Similarly, in many parts of Asia a dragon symbolizes good fortune and prosperity, but in the Bible it symbolizes evil and wickedness. In cases like these the translator will need to add a footnote to clarify the intended implication for the reader.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The second option is also often a good solution, provided that the local animal and the biblical animal share enough important similarities. Again the implications of using the substitute in figurative expressions should be carefully checked. It is important to avoid giving the wrong impression about the type of climate and landscape that existed in Israel in the choice of a local substitute. For instance, if “water buffalo” is substituted for “wild ox,” and “tiger” is substituted for “lion,” the reader automatically pictures Israel as a land of monsoon rain forest. It may be necessary in such cases to add a footnote indicating that the original text actually refers to different animals similar to those mentioned in the translation.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If the translator opts to use a generic expression where the original refers to a specific animal or bird (option 3), care should again be taken to recreate the correct implications in cases where the animal is referred to in a figurative expression. This can often be done by adding an adjective or a descriptive phrase. For instance, where jackals are not known but dogs are, “wild dog” may be the best local equivalent, but it would not carry the right implication in many contexts. However, a phrase like “wild dog of doom” may recreate the intended implication. Such “additions” are entirely justified, since the implication is clearly intended in the original text.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the case where borrowed words are used in the translation (option 4), the word should always be explained in a glossary at the end of the Bible. Care should also be taken to spell the borrowed word in a way that readers will be able to pronounce easily. If readers stumble and hesitate when reading these borrowed words, this is an indication that the transliteration needs improving at this point.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In spite of the importance of animals in the Bible, it is very confusing for many translators and Bible students to compare various Bible translations and discover that when it comes to the names of animals and birds, the versions hardly ever agree. For example, if the list of unclean birds in <s>00301101301000-00301101901000</s> is compared in different versions, it can be seen that what the Revised Standard Version (<a>RSV</a>) calls an “ibis” the New English Bible (<a>NEB</a>) calls a “screech owl,” the Jerusalem Bible (<a>JB</a>) a “cormorant,” and the New International Version (<a>NIV</a>) a “great owl.” In fact there are no two English versions in which the list is identical.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This all stems from the fact that many of the ancient Hebrew words for animals, birds, insects, and reptiles cannot be associated with a particular creature with any certainty. At best the commentators and translators can only make their best, educated guesses.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Even the scholars face problems. Many of them are experts in Hebrew and Greek, or in other ancient languages of the Middle East, but they have very little expertise when it comes to the study of animals, birds, and so forth. As a result, in some versions the text is made to refer to animals that never existed in Bible lands. Alternatively they may know all about the animals and birds of the region but have only a slight knowledge of biblical Hebrew and Greek.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This Handbook is designed to provide the Bible student with a better foundation on which to base interpretations of these problematic words. The zoological, linguistic, and archaeological facts have been studied in great detail (including all of the biblical contexts in which the words occur). The results of this study are summarized here, with an attempt to guide the student or translator to what we consider to be the most probable interpretation. Sometimes this involves not only the interpretation of a word for a particular animal, but also the interpretation of statements that are made about that animal in the Bible.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The book is divided into the following chapters:</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Within each chapter the animals are arranged in alphabetical order according to their names. Separate treatment is given to each of the creatures, even to those mentioned only once. To make things as useful as possible for the student/translator, each entry is arranged identically. The heading of the entry is based on the English name or names for the creature that is suggested by the author. This may not be the same name that appears in the English Bible version that the student or translator is using. In cases where there does not seem to be an entry on the animal you wish to study, go to the index l of Animals, and you will find it listed there. Alternatively, you can turn to the index of Scripture References. If you then go to the page number given in the index, you will find some discussion about the creature you are looking for.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>As a general rule, there is at least one Bible version and a group of scholars that support the author’s recommended translation, but in one or two cases the only support for the recommendation comes from some scholars but not from any current version of the English Bible. In all cases this is clearly indicated in the text.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>We hope that this Handbook will prove to be both helpful and interesting to all who read it. At times it has been necessary to use language that is fairly technical, but an attempt has been made to include in parentheses the more common, but slightly less precise, expressions.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>behemah</i> carries a broad spectrum of meanings, including all of the divisions in this chapter: animal in general, domestic animal, animal that is ridden, and wild animal. This word occurs some 190 times. A few representative references have been given for this word in each category; for the most part the context will give an indication of which meaning is appropriate.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The words <i>chay, chayah</i> and <i>cheva</i> in Hebrew and <i>zōon</i> in Greek are derived from a root meaning “life,” “to be alive". They can refer to any type of living creature. In some contexts the reference is to human beings in others to animals or to creatures that live in the water and in still others to all living creatures. However the reference is always to some form of animal life rather than to plants. In a few contexts the word <i>chay</i> functions as an adjective for example living “live” or “alive.” While the word <i>chay</i> does not indicate any specific animal it will usually be possible to tell from the context which animal is intended. However in some references in Genesis, Ezekiel, and Revelation there are no clues as to what kinds of animals or beings are meant. All we know is that they were alive. The words <i>tetrapodos</i> and <i>quadrupes</i> literally “four-footed” indicate animals in a general sense especially referring to mammals as opposed to snakes birds and other living creatures.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In most languages a general term for something living will have to be translated differently according to the context. In contexts where the reference is clearly to people, an expression meaning “living person” is a good equivalent, while “living animal", “living creatures", and the like would be the best equivalents in other contexts. In some cases a general word for “animal” will be appropriate; compare the Contemporary English Version (<a>CEV</a>) at : “These people are no better than senseless animals . . . .” In contexts of sacrifice the preferred expressions would be “live dove", “live goat", or another live sacrificial animal, according to which one is identified specifically in the context.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>06600400600040</s>: The word translated “living creatures” here means, in most contexts, “animals” but that specific meaning should not be used here. They are simply living beings, not classified either as animals or humans. They seem to be modeled after the living beings in <s>02600100501000-02600101401000</s>. In many cultures where there is a long Christian tradition employing a transliteration of “cherub” or “seraph” as the equivalent of “living creature” (and if translators feel that this term should continue to be employed), a footnote or a note in the glossary describing these creatures should be provided.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>These words refer to all kinds of livestock viewed as possessions or “living riches". Although they are translated as “cattle” in some versions they are used in these versions with an archaic more general meaning equivalent to “domestic animals” or “livestock". The meaning includes cattle sheep goats camels and donkeys or in other words any animals kept in large numbers for both domestic and commercial purposes.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>We cannot know for certain on which kind of animal the Good Samaritan placed the injured Jew. All we know is that it was an animal that was ridden or could carry a load. Thus many English translations have “beast” or “mount". But since we know that donkeys were the usual means of transport, we can surmise that a donkey was envisioned by Jesus when he told the parable. Thus some translations, such as <a>NIV</a>, have “donkey". The options then for the translator are to use an expression meaning “animal for riding” or “pack animal” or to use a word meaning “donkey".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>04402302400002</s>: Similarly we cannot know which kind of riding animals were provided for Paul when he left Jerusalem for Caesarea. Since we know that horses were the usual means of transport for the Romans, it is probable that they were horses. Here the translator can use either an expression like “animals to ride” or a word for “horses".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>04601503900028</s>: Here the context indicates that no specific group of animals is intended, and a general word meaning “animal” best fits this context.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>06601801300040</s>: All English translations have “cattle” in this verse, since the word is plural and is parallel to “sheep". It is almost certain that donkeys were not intended by the writer in this context, since donkeys were not exported as merchandise.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The fact that <i>behemah, chayah</i> and <i>cheva</i> indicate a wild or dangerous animal can usually be determined by modifiers in the text, such as “evil", “wild", “of the field", “of the earth", or “of the forest".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the books of the Maccabees the word <i>thērion</i>, literally “big animal” usually refers to the elephant. See <l target="FAUNA:2.14">2.14 Elephant</l>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>04402800400016 G04402800500012</s>: In verse 3 Paul is said to have been bitten by a viper (See <l target="FAUNA:4.10">4.10 Viper</l>), but in verses 4 and 5 in the Greek it is called “<i>to thērion</i> ("the dangerous creature"). In most English versions this is translated as “the snake", and in most languages this will be the natural thing to do. Some translations use an expression meaning “the poisonous thing".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>05801202000014</s>: In this verse the reference does not seem to be to dangerous animals in particular, but to animals generally. Many modern English versions translate <i>thērion</i> here as “an animal".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In all other cases for <i>thērion</i> an expression for “wild animal” or “dangerous animal” is used. The creature in Revelation, being symbolic in nature, is sometimes referred to in translations by the name of a particular animal that represents evil in the local culture (for example, a hyena). However, this should only be done as a very last resort, since the writer of Revelation uses a general rather than a specific word, leaving the reader to imagine what sort of dangerous animal he is referring to. Care should be taken to distinguish clearly between the “living creatures” of chapters 4-6, which represent good, and the “wild animals” of later chapters, which represent wickedness.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The following material is adapted from the UBS Handbook on the Revelation to John, comments on <s>06601100700016</s> and <s>06601300100012</s>:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word translated “beast” means simply “animal” and the American Translation (<a>AT</a>) and Phillips (<a>Phps</a>) translate here “the animal", which is a bit strange in English. A translator must find, if possible, a distinctive word for these creatures. Perhaps use can be made of words taken from legends or fairy tales, where fantastic animals are fairly common. Here something like “monster” or “wild beast", or even “ogre", may be appropriate. In certain languages where there are only the two categories, domesticated animals or wild animals, it will be necessary to define “beast” with a phrase such as “a terrible wild animal", “a huge, horrible animal", or even “a frightening, savage animal".</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In <s>00501400401000-00501400601000</s> there is a list of clean animals which contains three domestic animals, about which there is no difference of opinion, and seven other vegetation-eating animals, about which there is considerable difference of opinion.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>It seems useful, before trying to identify each, to try to deduce from the archeological evidence which animals of this type would have been familiar to the people of the period. It is certain that they would have known the gazelle, the oryx, the ibex, the fallow deer, and the mountain sheep, since all of these were found in the region. These animals can be related to the Hebrew words <i>tsvi, te’o, ’aqo, ’ayal</i>, and <i>zemer</i> respectively. That accounts for five of the seven. The remaining two are a problem.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Among the wild animals found in biblical lands from very early times which would certainly have been considered clean are the red hartebeest and an antelope of the kobus type. It seems likely that the problematic Hebrew word <i>yachmur</i> refers to one of these, probably the hartebeest. If this is correct, then it would seem that Solomon kept herds of red hartebeest in later times in Israel (<s>01100402301000</s>). This type of herding of wild hartebeest was common in Mesopotamia and Egypt.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The other problematic Hebrew word, <i>dishon</i>, may refer to the kobus antelope, or to the addax antelope, which was another animal kept in herds in Egypt.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>What is clear is that all “game animals” known to the Israelites -- deer, antelopes, gazelles, wild goats, and wild sheep -- were included in the list of clean animals. Retaining this fact in the translation is probably more important than establishing the identity of each of the Hebrew words.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0006_addax"/>The Septuagint renders this word as <i>pugargos</i> (transliterated as “pygarg” by the King James Version [<a>KJV</a> ]) which means “white rump.” This Greek name could refer to an antelope of the <i>Kobus</i> family which includes the Waterbuck, the Defassa Waterbuck <i>Kobus defassa</i> and the White-eared Kob <i>Kobus megaceros</i> all of which have a white ring around their rump. The latter two species were well known in biblical times. Most types of gazelle also have a white rump.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However it has become almost a tradition to associate the name with another antelope <i>Addax nasomaculatus</i> which strangely enough does not have a white rump (compare New American Bible [<a>NAB</a> ]). The addax is a northwest African species and there is no firm evidence that it has ever existed in the wild anywhere east of Libya. There is a good possibility however that the addax was kept in herds by the Egyptians in a way similar to the way deer are kept in deer parks in Europe but for sacrificial purposes as well as for food. Solomon may also have kept them like this.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Many scholars relate the name <i>dishon</i> to the Hebrew, root d-w-sh which would make the name mean something like “plodder.” This would fit the addax which has large hooves for its size and moves generally at a rhythmic walk. Some scholars suggest with some supporting evidence that <i>dishon</i> is <i>Oryx leucoryx</i> the Arabian or White Oryx. Linguistic support for this identification comes from the Akkadian name for the oryx, <i>da-as-su</i>, the root of which is said to be close to the Hebrew root <i>d-sh-n</i>. However another Hebrew word <i>te’o</i> is also interpreted by zoologists as “oryx.” Since this word also occurs in the list of clean animals in this verse it is unlikely that the word <i>dishon</i> also means “oryx.” The choice seems to be between the addax and the kobus antelope neither having overwhelming support (see also <l target="FAUNA:2.7">2.7 Bubal hartebeest</l>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0901_waterbuck"/>The <i>Kobus</i> antelopes are fairly large, about 1.3 meters (4 feet) at the shoulder, with fairly long fur. The males have horns what grow out at about forty-five degrees from the horizontal at the base then curve upward and forward. The horns are often over half a meter (20 inches) in length. The waterbuck and defassa are gray to grayish fawn, while the kobs are reddish. They live in small herds (the kobs often in large herds) in the vicinity of rivers or swamps. They are grazers, eating grass and waterweeds.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The addax has spiral horns and broad hoofs and is a pale brown color in winter but almost white in summer. They are about the size of donkeys.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>. The list of clean animals in <s>00501400501000</s> includes seven names. Today’s English Version (<a>TEV</a>) has reduced this to four, “deer, wild sheep, wild goats, or antelopes.” These are cover terms that do not actually include all that is mentioned in the original. Gazelles, for example, are omitted. In settings where it is difficult to find seven names, this may be a solution.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In sub-Saharan Africa where waterbuck, lechwe, defassa, or kobs are known, the name for one of these could be used. Antelope similar to the addax include the Greater and Lesser Kudu, <i>Strepsiceros strepsiceros</i> and <i>Strepsiceros imberbis</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>On the Indian sub-continent the nearest equivalent would be the Nylghaie <i>Boselaphus tragocamelus</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Elsewhere a phrase such as “white-rumped antelope” or a transliteration could be used.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0048_baboon"/>In Africa Asia and Europe two of the primate families are the monkeys <i>Cercopithecidae</i> which have tails and the true apes <i>Pongidae</i> which have no tails. All of the evidence from ancient Egypt and the ancient Middle East indicates that monkeys and baboons were known but there is no reference at all in literature or art to apes without tails. Thus the English translation apes (which in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries referred to any kind of non-human primate) is probably not the best term in modern English despite the fact that all English translations use this word."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Bodenheimer identifies the Hebrew <i>qof</i> as a word and as a letter of the alphabet with the ancient Egyptian root <i>g-f</i> and the hieroglyph <i>kafu</i> both of which refer to the baboon. Both <i>qof</i> and <i>kafu</i> are deemed by other scholars to be onomatopoeic (that is the name sounds like the noise the animal makes) as is the case with many animal names. Since the Yellow Baboon <i>Papio cynocephalus</i> the Anubis Baboon <i>Papio anubis doguerra</i> and the Sacred Hamadryas Baboon <i>Papio hamdryas</i> were all well known in the ancient Middle East the above identifications seem most reasonable.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Baboons (various subspecies of the <i>papio</i> species) are large primates with long tails and doglike muzzles. Adults are often the size of a fairly large dog. Some large males develop a mane like a lion. They spend most of their time on the ground and eat a variety of roots, shoots, fruits, leaves, insects, and small reptiles. In some areas they hunt and eat small mammals such as mice, hares, or even juvenile gazelles. They live in troops of between thirty and eighty individuals, and the troop has a definite social structure, led by a dominant female. They are usually light brown, but older males sometimes turn gray.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Baboons or related species such as mandrills are found in rocky hill country in most parts of Africa except the Sahara and the northwest.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In Africa the local name for baboon, mandrill, or gelada (Ethiopia) would be a good equivalent. Elsewhere, where there are large local monkeys that spend a lot of time on the ground, the local name for this species may be a good choice. In southern, eastern, and southeastern Asia, the larger varieties of macaque or rhesus monkeys are similar to baboons in many ways. In South America a generic word for the larger howler monkeys would be suitable, or where there is no generic word, a specific word for one of the howlers can be used.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In places where none of the above are known, an expression meaning big monkeys could be used, or a transliteration of the word from the original Hebrew or dominant language of the area.</Paragraph>

The rest of the cargo on board Solomon’s ships is from East Africa (the ancient ivory objects discovered by archeologists in the land to date are all made from African ivory) while peacocks originate from India and Myanmar which used to be known as Burma.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If <i>qof</i> refers to the baboon then it is likely that <i>tuki</i> refers to one of the smaller long-tailed monkeys of the <i>guenon</i> genus. The most common of these are the “green” and “blue” Vervet Monkeys <i>Cercopithecus aethiops</i> found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, Sudan, and Ethiopia. In ancient times these monkeys being easy to capture were exported as pets all over the Middle East and Europe.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0185_donkey"/>These Hebrew and Greek words (with the exception of <i>pōlos</i> and <i>hupozugion</i> see discussion below) all definitely refer to the Domestic Donkey <i>equus asinus</i>. However the different words do have slight semantic differences among them.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Chamor</i> and <i>onos</i> are the generic words for donkey while <i>’athon</i> (feminine gender) refers specifically to a saddle donkey or a donkey used for riding. A saddle donkey is usually a large strong female donkey the males are too difficult to control when they are near a female in heat. The Hebrew word is derived from a root that means “strong".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>‘Ayir</i> refers to the young male or jack donkey (probably with an emphasis on its liveliness and the difficulty in controlling it since the Hebrew root means something like “frisky").</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Onarion</i> means a young donkey of either sex. Some languages will have a special word for a young donkey. This will be appropriate for translating <i>onarion</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>hupozugion</i> often translated “donkey", actually indicates any beast of burden. Walter Bauer, the famous German New Testament scholar, has argued very convincingly that the animal referred to in <s>04002100500030</s> in the expression <i>epi pōlon huion hupozugiou</i> is the foal of a horse not a donkey (1953:220-229). In some languages it will be possible to express this in a way that does not designate a specific species of animal`, as in “beast of burden” (<a>NEB</a><a>JB</a> Revised English Bible [<a>REB</a> ]). <i>pōlos</i> usually refers to a foal, that is a young horse, unless a word for donkey follows (see also <l target="FAUNA:2.32">2.32 Wild ass</l>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Donkeys are domestic animals belonging to the same family as the horse, but they are smaller and have longer ears. The donkey bred and used in the Middle East is the domesticated Nubian or Somali Wild Ass <i>Equus Asinus africanus</i>. In its original wild state this was a gray ass with pale, whitish belly and dark rings on the lower part of the legs. It was domesticated in Egypt as early as 2500 B.C. In its domesticated version, as a result of interbreeding with donkeys from Europe and Persia, the donkey came to be a variety of colors from dark brown, through light brown to the original gray and occasionally white. The Hebrew <i>chamor</i> comes from a root meaning “reddish brown."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0032_donkey_with_dog"/>Donkeys are good pack animals being able to carry as much as the larger mule without the latter’s unpredictable moods. They also have great stamina and are easy to feed since they eat almost any available vegetation. Larger individual animals (usually females) are also often used for riding.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Donkeys were highly prized in biblical times especially females since they were suitable for packing and riding and had the potential for producing offspring. Donkeys were seen as man’s best friend in the animal kingdom. They were the common man’s means of transport and many ordinary families owned a donkey. They were used for plowing and for turning large millstones as well as a means of transport.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Today domestic donkeys are found all over savannah Africa the Middle East South and Central Asia Europe Latin America and Australia. They do not seem to be reared in rain forest or monsoon areas but they are nevertheless often known in these areas.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>A donkey was considered to be a basic domestic requirement and thus the number of donkeys available was a means of measuring the relative prosperity of a society at any given time. While only powerful political or military people rode horses (which were usually owned by the state) the common people rode donkeys. This is the significance of the passage in <s>03800900900050</s>: the victorious king would return to the city riding a donkey thus identifying himself as a common Israelite rather than a victorious warlord.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In the majority of languages there is a local or a borrowed word for donkey. This is the obvious choice. In areas of Southeast Asia, Papua New Guinea, West Africa, and other places, where donkeys are rare or unknown, the word from the dominant major language or trade language (for example, English, Spanish, French, Chinese, or Arabic) is often transliterated.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In most contexts <i>’athon</i> should be translated by the equivalent of “female” donkey, but in some contexts riding donkey is better.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>‘ayir</i> should be translated according to the specific context. In <s>00103201501000</s> the translation should definitely be the equivalent of “male donkey", and probably also in <s>00701000400018</s> and <s>00701201400026</s>. The significance of these latter passages is that female donkeys were the more normal choice of mount.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>01801101200012</s> the emphasis is probably on the friskiness of the donkey, and the translation should be the equivalent of “He ties his young donkey to a grapevine, his frisky young ass to the best of the vines” (indicating a certain amount of irresponsibility, and perhaps extravagance).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>01801101200012</s> and <s>03800900900050</s> the obvious emphasis is on the youth of the donkey, so the equivalent of “colt", “foal", “young donkey", and so on should be used.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The emphasis in <s>02303000600040 H02303002400012</s> is neutral, so the ordinary word for “donkey” is appropriate.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0061_bats"/>The ancient Israelites, like many other peoples around the world, classified bats as birds since they fly. Bats are, however, mammals belonging to the order <i>chiroptera</i>. The Hebrew word is a generic term referring to any of the thirty-two different species of bat found in Israel. Bats are found around the world in all areas except the tundra of the far north and Antarctica. The bats indigenous to the Holy Land are of two types, those that eat fruit and those that eat insects.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Bats are the only mammals that can really fly (although some other mammals are able to glide from higher to lower places). They have fur, not feathers, and do not lay eggs, but give birth to their young. They have slender elongated forelegs and fingers that support a flap of skin joining their fingers to their toes, and this functions as a wing. They fly around at night and hang upside down from trees or overhanging rocks during the day. They have specially adapted ears and brains that enable them to gauge distance accurately by listening to the sounds they make echoing off objects in the vicinity.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Bats in Israel range in size from those about the size of mice to those about the size of large rats.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Since bats are found everywhere, it should not be hard to find a word for them. Words for bats that eat insects or fruit are suitable, but words for the vampire bats, fish-eating bats, or bird-eating bats of tropical Latin America should not be used. Since in many cultures bats are not associated with ruin and desolation, it may be necessary to use a phrase meaning something like “abandoned . . . to the bats” in <s>02300202000054</s>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0066_bears"/>The bear that was known in biblical times was the Syrian Brown Bear <i>Ursus arctos syriacus</i>. The same word in Hebrew refers to either male or female bears, and it is the gender of the associated words that will indicate the gender of the bear in a specific context (see below under <u>Translation</u>:).</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The Syrian brown bear is very large, similar to the North American Grizzly Bear <i>Ursus horribilis</i>, or the European Brown Bear <i>Ursus arctos</i>. It has a rather doglike face. It has thick fur, and walks on all fours, but may stand up on its back legs to get a better view. When it stands up like this it may be 2 meters (6 feet) or more tall. It may also weigh over two hundred kilos (440 pounds). Like many other bears Syrian brown bears accumulate fat by gorging themselves in the summer and autumn, and then they sleep through the winter in caves or holes they have dug under logs.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Although its basic food is roots, berries, wild fruit, mice, and lizards, occasionally a rogue bear might kill small livestock. Bears are not able to see very well, and this means that often a person gets quite close to a bear before either one sees the other. The bear is then likely to attack, striking out with its strong digging claws and perhaps biting. Female bears are very protective of their young.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>For translators in the Northern Hemisphere, finding a word for bear is not usually too difficult. The best choice is a generic word for “bear” rather than the specific word for a type of bear. If a specific word must be used, the word for the grizzly bear is suitable in North America, while in Europe and parts of Asia the European brown bear is the closest relative to the Syrian brown bear. In parts of mainland Asia where the brown bear is not known, the word for the Himalayan Black Bear <i>Selenarctos thibetanus</i> is the best choice. The word for the sloth bear of India and Ceylon, or for the sun and moon bears of Malaysia, Indo-China, and Indonesia should be avoided, since these bears have small teeth and are not dangerous.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the higher parts of South America the word for the Spectacled Bear <i>Tremarctos ornatus</i> can be used if this animal is known to the readers. For translators elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere, the problem is more difficult, especially in areas where bears are not known. The use of the name for a local animal is seldom successful, since the more dangerous local animals are usually too different from bears. The only alternative is to transliterate the name from the dominant major or trade language of the area, or from the original biblical language, with a glossary item saying something like: “A bear is a large dangerous animal with big claws and teeth."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In some parts of central and southern Africa the name for the brown hyena is “mbere” or “bere", but even though the word sounds like “bear", two very different animals are involved. This word should not be used for “bear", since the hyena is associated with witchcraft, while the bear is not.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0286_hartebeest"/>Although the majority of English versions (<a>RSV</a><a>NEB</a><a>JB</a><a>NIV</a><a>REB</a><a>NAB</a>) have roebuck, which is the male form of roe deer many biblical zoologists reject this rendering. They argue that roe deer while being fairly common in biblical times live singly or in pairs for part of the year but not in herds they are extremely shy and difficult to hunt as they live in thick undergrowth and seldom leave it. They are rarely even seen in areas where they live. Thus the argument goes it would have been almost impossible for large numbers of roe deer to have been brought to Solomon’s table on a daily basis as recorded in <s>01100402301000</s>. However others argue that trapping roe deer would have been easy even though hunting was not.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The translation “fallow deer” (<a>KJV</a>) is also rejected since it is almost universally accepted that the Hebrew <i>’ayal</i> is the word for the fallow deer, and this word occurs earlier in the list of Solomon’s provisions.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The consensus among the zoologists supports the translation “bubal hartebeest” which was well known and could easily have been kept in semi-domesticated herds as were deer. In Egypt and to a lesser extent in Sinai the bubal hartebeest was depicted in murals and stone carvings and many mummified hartebeests have also been found in Egyptian sites. Both Canaanite and Israelite archeological sites have yielded hartebeest bones in fairly large quantities. They have even been found in close proximity to Canaanite altars suggesting that the Canaanites sacrificed them.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew name <i>yachmur</i> is probably derived from a root <i>ch-m-r</i>, which means “red” and is the same root from which the Hebrew name for a donkey is derived. The bubal hartebeest is both red and remarkably like a horned donkey. It is also known as the red hartebeest. The word “hartebeest” is a word borrowed from Dutch and literally means “deer-cow".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Interestingly, the Septuagint translates <i>yachmur</i> as <i>bubalos</i> “water buffalo", which was an animal well known to the Israelites. Water buffalo were domesticated in Babylonia and Syria and were found in the marshes of northern Israel around Lake Huleh. However this translation has no support among modern scholars. The name bubal in bubal hartebeest is derived from this same Greek word.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Roe Deer <i>capreolus capreolus</i> are small deer, the adult males having short horns that have three prongs. Their fur is brownish in summer and gray in winter. They live singly or in pairs in the undergrowth of forests and thick woodland, never moving more than one or two meters (3-6 feet) from cover, even when feeding.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Bubal or Red Hartebeest <i>alcelaphus buselaphus</i> is a large antelope about 1.5 meters (5 feet) high at the shoulder. Both males and females have very long faces with a large lump on the head from which sprout short thick horns. These curve upward and forward for half their length and then angle sharply backwards. Hartebeests are reddish brown in color.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>They are plains animals and graze in herds often among gazelles zebras or other antelope. Although they look slightly ungainly with their sloping backs hartebeests are very good runners and can sustain high speed for as much as 10 kilometers (6 miles) easily outrunning any other animal over this distance.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>These animals were once found all over North Africa and the plains of the land of Israel where they were known as “wild cows” by Bedouin. In some Jewish versions of the Bible <i>yachmur</i> is translated as “wild cow". The bubal hartebeest has disappeared from those areas, but it is still found in the Kalahari semidesert in Botswana and in adjacent areas in Angola Namibia Zambia and Zimbabwe. Very similar hartebeests <i>alcelaphus lelwel</i> and <i>alcelaphus cokei</i> are also found in Chad, Sudan, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. In the latter two countries they are known by their Swahili name “<i>kongoni</i> “. Related animals are the Tiang or Topi <i>damaliscus korrigum</i> found in Cameroon Zaire Uganda and Kenya the Tsessebe <i>Damaliscus lunatus</i> of Zimbabwe and Mozambique; and the Cape Hartebeest <i>alcelaphus caama</i>, the Bontebok <i>damaliscus pygargus</i>, and the Blesbok <i>damaliscus albifrons</i> of South Africa.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0189_dromedary"/>While there is no doubt about the identity of the animal referred to by the above Hebrew, Greek and Latin words there has been some difference of opinion among scholars about the reference to camels in <s>00101201600044</s>. Before 1960 it was thought that domestic camels were not in use in Egypt until around 1300 B.C. The evidence used in this argument was the fact that no hieroglyphs (pictures representing words) for camels or illustrations of camels seem to have been in use before that time.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However since then a limestone carving of a loaded camel and some line drawings scratched in stone have been found all dated by archeologists as coming from a period around 3000 B.C. Many camel bones from the period 1800-1600 B.C. have also been uncovered in ancient town sites and a camel hair cord dated about 2500 B.C. was found in Faiyum near Cairo. This new evidence has led scholars to conclude that domestic camels were indeed in use since about 3000 B.C. but that taboos associated with them may have been responsible for the fact that they were not depicted in hieroglyphs on commemorative stones or tomb decorations and that camel figurines were not made before 1550 B.C.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Whether or not these scholars are correct in their conclusions there is no doubt that the Hebrew text as we have it contains the word for “camel", and <s>00101201600044</s> has to be translated accordingly.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0052_bactrian"/>There were two types of camel known in Bible times the most common being the Arabian Dromedary <i>camelus dromedarius</i>, which was indigenous to the area. The two-humped Bactrian Camel <i>camelus bactrianus</i> was also known and prized, but it was imported from Central Asia.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Camels belong to the same family as the South American llama, vicuna, alpaca, and guanaco, but camels are much larger and have a big fatty hump on their backs. Bactrian camels may reach a height of about two meters (6.5 feet), while dromedaries are even bigger. Dromedaries are a uniform light fawn color, while Bactrian camels are darker, especially in winter when they grow longer fur.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Camels do not have hooves but a large footpad with two broad toes ideally suited to walking on sand. In other ways too they are ideally suited to life in desert areas. They store excess food in their humps and this makes it possible for them to go a long time without eating. Special blood cells also enable them to go without water for long periods. They also have a very efficient digestive system and can extract the maximum amount of nutrition from apparently dry vegetation. This adaptation to harsh environments means that camels can make long journeys through dry areas which would be beyond the abilities of other types of pack animal such as donkeys. Camels were used for riding and for carrying heavy loads. They were also used to pull carts.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In winter the fur of camels thickens and grows longer and then when summer comes they shed their winter fur in large wads. These wads of camel hair are collected and twisted into cords and ropes or spun into thread which is then used for weaving coarse cloth. This cloth was usually used for making tents but it was sometimes used for making outer robes.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Camels’ milk was used as food and drink but their meat was considered unclean by the Israelites.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In areas where camels are not known, the word is often transliterated from Hebrew or the dominant language of the area. However, in some languages descriptive names have been invented. In some South American languages names meaning “hump-backed llama” or “big alpaca with a hump” have been used. Elsewhere expressions such as “hump-backed horse” have been used. A fuller description should usually be included in a glossary or word list.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00103201501000</s>: Here the reference is to female camels that are providing milk, and the expression is often translated as “thirty camels for milking", or “thirty mother camels giving milk".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02306000600008</s>: Although the word <i>beker</i> is probably related to the Hebrew root <i>B-K-R</i> meaning “early” or “the first", the usage in <s>02306000600008</s> seems not to place any special emphasis on the youth of the camels, but perhaps on their superior quality. The word is used to provide a qualifying synonym (a word having basically the same meaning) for “camel” in order to complete a poetic couplet. The English word “dromedary” has this same function in <a>KJV</a>, <a>NEB</a>, and <a>JB</a>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In languages that have two words for camel, in <s>02306000600008</s> the usual word for camel can be used in the first part of the couplet and the lesser known word can be used for <i>beker</i> in the parallel line of the poem. However, in languages with only one word for camel, or in languages in which a borrowed or made-up word is used, it is better to use the usual word for camel in the first line of the couplet and then use a suitable qualifying expression to complete the couplet; for example:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Camel caravans will cover the land,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The best camels from Midian and Ephah;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>And from Sheba . . . .</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>02400202300036</s> the context clearly indicates that <i>bikrah</i> refers to a female camel ready for mating, that is, “in heat". The word translated “wild” in <a>TEV</a> is better translated “berserk” (compare “frantic” in <a>JB</a>). The full expression can be translated as “You have gone berserk like a female camel in heat."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02306602000062</s>: The word <i>kirkaroth</i> (singular, <i>kirkarah</i>), used only once in the Bible, seems to refer to camels used for riding rather than for carrying merchandise. In the context, which depicts people coming from distant foreign lands, the reference may be to Bactrian camels from Central Asia. In most languages the normal word for camel can be used in this verse. In languages that have different markers for pack animals and animals for riding, the word for camel in this verse can be marked as “camel for riding". Where Bactrian camels are known, the word for this type of camel can be used here.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>04001902400014 G04002302400018 G04101002500006 G04201802500008</s>: In these passages the large size of the camel is contrasted with a small eye of a needle in the one case, and with a small mosquito in the other. In some languages where camels are not well known, translators have used the name of a better known large animal, such as “bull", “horse", or “elephant", in order to retain the impact of Jesus’ words for the local readers. In such cases it is necessary to use a footnote to the effect that the Greek text has “camel". Translators should avoid using the names of animals that were not known to the original audience, such as “moose” or “kangaroo", or words that would have had a negative connotation, such as “big pig".</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0117_cat"/>Cats were first domesticated in Egypt or Ethiopia about 1600 or 1700 B.C. and in China about the same time. It seems likely that in Africa the African Wild Cat <i>felis lybica</i> in its search for mice and rats began to inhabit granaries and was finally coaxed into people’s homes by feeding it scraps of meat. These earliest domestic cats were kept not simply as pets but for the control of the rodents. In Egypt the goddess Basht was given the cat as her symbol and she is usually depicted as having a cat’s head. Cats were also mummified and buried with important people. Basht was the divinity believed to inhabit and govern the region east of the Nile which is where the Israelites lived from the time of Joseph to the time of the Exodus. These associations of the cat with Basht probably explain why there is no mention of cats in the protocanonical books of the Bible and the only time cats are mentioned in the deuterocanonical books is in relation to Babylonian temples.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the centuries following the domestication of the cat the domestic Libyan cat was adopted by neighboring nations and soon domestic cats were found as far away as India. Wherever the domestic cat was kept it interbred with local wild cats resulting in the many variants now found. The cat referred to in the Letter of Jeremiah (<s>07300102100038</s>) may have been the African wild cat (which was found wild even far to the east of Babylonia) or another local wild cat such as the European Wild Cat <i>Felis sylvestris</i>. In ancient times wild cats were considered to be beneficial since they kept down the rat population and thus offered some protection for crops and granaries. As a result wild cats were probably common in towns and villages. However the cat referred to may have been a domestic cat probably <i>Felis libyca domestica</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0917_wild_cat"/>The African wild cat in both its domesticated and wild forms is a fairly large yellowish gray tabby cat, with dark stripes radiating vertically down its sides from a dark central stripe along its backbone. Like all cats it has five toes on its forefeet and four toes on its hind feet and retractable claws. Its tail is ringed and is roughly half as long as its body.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Commentators are divided in their opinions about whether or not the cat referred to in the Letter of Jeremiah (<s>07300102100038</s>) was a wild cat or a domesticated one. It is probably best to use the local word for an ordinary domestic cat. Even in parts of the world where there are no indigenous cats, they are now fairly well known, and it should not be hard to find the right word. In those languages where animals with skins of one color are differentiated from those with skins with marks on them, the word for a cat with markings should be used.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Cattle herding and breeding among the Hebrews are first mentioned in <s>00101201600024</s>, when Abram is given cattle by the king of Egypt and brings them back to Canaan. From this time on cattle formed an important element in Hebrew life and culture, although ownership of cattle was limited to relatively wealthy people. The area of Gilead in particular, became known for the number and the quality of cattle there (<s>00403200101000 H00403200401000 H01300500901000</s>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>English terminology</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>For the sake of readers who are not mother tongue speakers of English it seems best to clarify the rather bewildering variety of collective terms for cattle. Even mother tongue speakers sometimes have difficulties with these.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Cattle</b>: This word in modern English is a plural form but there is no singular or countable form of the word. So when referring to a specific number of animals of this kind one has either to use expressions such as “five head of cattle” or to specify the gender of the animals in expressions such as “four cows and one bull.” In an earlier form of English the word meant “possessions” then it came to mean “livestock” and finally in modern English it is a more specific word referring collectively to any domestic cow-like animals whether they be cows, bulls, oxen, calves, bullocks, steers, or heifers.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Cows and Bulls</b>: Although cows are strictly speaking adult female cattle the word in modern English is sometimes used to mean “cattle” without reference to gender especially when using numbers. Thus “400 cows” can mean “400 head of cattle.” <a>TEV</a> sometimes uses the word in this sense. The word for adult male cattle, “bulls", is never used with this more general meaning.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Oxen</b>: In modern English this word refers to bulls that have been castrated in order to make them more docile so that they can be used as work animals. The effects of castration were discovered very soon after cattle were first domesticated and although the Jews were forbidden to castrate animals they seem to have obtained such animals from gentile neighbors or ignored the prohibition.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A more archaic usage of the English “oxen” has the general meaning of “cattle". This archaic usage is preserved in words such as “oxgoat", “oxtail", or “wild oxen", where the gender of the animals is not a component of the meaning. It is this archaic general sense in which most English versions use the word especially when quantifying. Thus in these versions “400 oxen” means “400 head of cattle” not “400 castrated bulls.” This is the reason why we find reference to oxen being sacrificed even though there is a specific prohibition against sacrificing animals that have been castrated.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Steers</b>: These are castrated bulls that are raised for slaughtering not for work.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Bullocks</b>: This word generally means young bulls but in some dialects of English such as Australian it can also mean the same as “oxen” or “steers", that is, castrated bulls.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Heifers</b>: This is the word used for young cows that have not yet given birth to their first calf.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Calves</b>: These are young cattle of either sex.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Dairy products</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0159_cows"/>Cows, sheep and goats were all milked by the Israelites. However because of the climate in which they lived and the way in which milk was stored in goatskin bags the milk did not stay fresh very long. They probably drank sour milk as do most other nomadic herding societies. When sour milk is shaken lumps called “curds” separate from the rest of the milk which then becomes a thin and watery liquid called “whey". The curds can be eaten as they are and this is what is often translated as “butter” in English versions. It is not, however, what is normally called butter in the modern world. The curds can also be packed together salted and dried in flat cakes. This is what is referred to as “cheese” in most English versions. It did not keep as well as modern cheese which has a rind or skin to keep it fresh.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>By the time Abram moved into Canaan, several breeds of cattle had already been developed in Mesopotamia and Egypt. From bas-reliefs and, in the latter country, from paintings in tombs dating to about 3000 B.C., we know that both long-horn and short-horn varieties and varieties with and without humps were known. There were already several different colors (brown, black, white) and many combinations of these, even at that early date.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Cattle were ritually clean animals suitable for sacrifice and a measure of wealth. In all of the lands surrounding Israel cattle especially bulls were associated at various times with gods and were worshiped. This was true of Egypt Mesopotamia and the Canaanite tribes. It was true too of other cultures from the Minoans in the west to the Hindus in the east. Thus as well as being a source of food and wealth for the Israelites and their sacrificial animals they were also a source of temptation.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><i>’Abir</i> literally means mighty one and is used of people, angels, God himself, and animals. When used of animals it may refer to war-horses or to bulls. The context usually, but not always, gives the clue as to which sense is meant. The contexts in which bulls are meant unambiguously are <s>01905001300008 H01906803100010</s>; and probably <s>02405001100042</s>, although in the latter verse <a>RSV</a>, <a>TEV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, and <a>NAB</a> translate the word as “stallions". The parallelism is better retained by translating “grazing heifer in heat” and “bellowing bull” rather than “neighing stallion” in the second line.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02303400700016</s> is an interesting case. The <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> rendering “bison” can be discounted. For one thing to translate like this turns a prophecy of doom into a prophecy about a hunting expedition, which is highly unlikely; but perhaps even more serious, there is no evidence at all that the European bison, also known as the Wisent <i>Bison bonasus</i>, was ever found anywhere near as far south as Edom.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The poetry in this verse plays on the fact that <i>’abir</i> can refer to people as well as to bulls. The poem speaks of a sacrifice being prepared by Yahweh, and then, by using an ambiguous expression for the sacrificial animals, the inference is that people, not animals, are to be killed. This is reflected well in the <a>JB</a> and <a>TEV</a> translations. The poetic verse means something like:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Like wild oxen, they themselves will fall dead,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Like sacrificial bulls (parim), their mighty men.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>’aluf, ’elef</i>: These words are probably related to the root <i>’a-l-f-</i>, to teach or train. Thus ’aluf/’elef indicates tame or domesticated animals. A general word for “cattle” is recommended.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Behemah</i> usually means “animal", “domestic animal", or “livestock". In the passages listed above, it should be translated “cattle". See also <l target="FAUNA:1">1 Animals, general</l>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Baqar</i> is the most general word for “cattle". In its widest usage it basically means “herds” and may include sheep and goats, but always includes cattle. Often it means only cattle and is used in contrast to sheep and goats. In some contexts, where <i>baqar</i> are referred to as having given birth, it is clear that only cows are meant.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In translating <i>baqar</i> translators should first determine whether the context refers to livestock in general, or to cattle specifically, and translate accordingly. Generally when an English translation has “herds” without specifying which animals are meant, the meaning of <i>baqar</i> is “livestock” or “domestic animals” in general. If the reference is to cattle, use a general word. In languages where there are many words for cattle, depending on gender, age, color, breed, and other things, the most all-inclusive word for cattle should be used, except when a specific context indicates otherwise, such as <s>00302201900014</s>, where bulls are obviously meant.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Meri’</i> refers to a stall-fed animal, usually a calf, that is reserved for sacrifice. It is best translated “stall-fed calf", “fattened calf", or “choice calf.” The <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> translation “buffalo", comes from a comparison with similar words in other Semitic languages which might mean “buffalo,” but this is not widely accepted by commentators since similar words in related languages often have different meanings. For instance the English “deer” and the German “Tier” are related, but have different meanings (the German word means “animal"). In <s>02301100600032</s> the Masoretic Text includes “and a fatted calf” but the Septuagint and the Vulgate follow a different text, and thus most modern versions do not include this phrase.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>‘egel</i> and <i>‘eglah</i> indicate male and female calves (heifers) respectively. These words are also used for the images of calves worshiped by the Canaanites. <a>NEB</a>, <a>NIV</a>, and <a>REB</a> make this clear in the book of Hosea by translating the words as “calf-gods” and “calf-idols". Most such contexts are self-evident, but <s>02801000501000</s> is one reference to calf-idols which most versions do not adequately identify. See, however, the New Century Version (<a>NCV</a>) with the “calf-shaped idol". <a>CEV</a> renders “idols” and adds a footnote: “The Hebrew text has ‘calves,’ referring to the idols made in the shape of calves.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Par</i> refers specifically to young bulls reserved for sacrifice. Some commentators deduce that these are firstborn bulls; others believe that the bulls were especially fattened. This latter position is reflected in the <a>JB</a> translation of <s>00700602500032</s>. It is likely that both positions are correct. The age of the sacrificial bull varied from one year to three years and older, so the translation “calf” is a little misleading. <i>Par</i> is best translated by a phrase meaning “sacrificial bull” the first time it appears in a paragraph, and then simply bull thereafter in the paragraph.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>parah</i> is the feminine form of <i>par</i> and refers specifically to young cows specially fattened and reserved for sacrifice. The translation heifer is unwarranted, since in many contexts <i>parah</i> is used for a cow that has a calf. <i>parah</i>, then, is best translated simply as cow, but in <s>03000400100012</s> fat cows is warranted. In <s>02800401600006</s> <i>parah</i> is used in a simile for stubbornness. This is possibly a reference to the fact that a cow that has been stall-fed for all of its life would be reluctant to move very far from its stall. It would thus probably be difficult to move when the time came to make the journey to Jerusalem for its sacrifice. <a>TEV</a> uses “mule” in this verse, since this is the animal that is famed for stubbornness in English culture. If cows are not considered to be stubborn animals in the translator’s culture, a similar substitution can be made, if the substituted animal is one likely to have been known by the people of Bible times. It is not advisable to use a word like water buffalo since this brings with it the inference that Israel was an area of heavy rainfall.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>shor</i> is a general word for individual cattle. They may be male, female, or both (as <a>NIV</a> sometimes indicates in a footnote when translating the word as “ox"), and only the context can indicate which gender is meant. <i>shor</i> presents a problem to English translators because English has no countable equivalent. We have to use forms that specify the gender. The most common translation of this word in English is “ox", but this is in the archaic sense of “head of cattle” and does not indicate the gender of the animal, nor whether or not it has been castrated. Some modern versions use “cow” in this same genderless sense. In other languages where there is a word for individual cows, oxen, or bulls without reference to gender, this word should be used for <i>shor</i>. If, as in English, gender has to be specified, the context can usually guide in the choice. In cases where the gender is not determined by the context, a general plural word for cattle can be used.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Tor</i> is the general Aramaic word for cattle. In English the problem of quantifying results in “young bulls” being used in the Ezra passages, and “ox” in the Daniel passages. In Ezra the meaning is cattle for sacrifices, while in Daniel the reference is to cattle generally.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Bous</i> is the usual Greek word for cattle, male or female. In translation a general word that may refer to a bull or a cow is the best equivalent. In John the animals driven from the Temple definitely were not “oxen” in the technical meaning of castrated bulls.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>04002200400038</s>: The word <i>sitistos</i> indicates stall-fed cattle that are being fattened for slaughter.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Tauros</i> is the usual word for “bull". English versions vary between “ox” and “bull", but there really is no difference in meaning between the various contexts in the New Testament. It is recommended that translators use a word meaning “bull” throughout. Bulls were used for feasting and sacrifice (<s>04002200400038 G05800901300020 G05801000400008</s>). The Greeks associated bulls (not oxen) with the gods (<s>04401401300022</s>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Moschos</i> is the word for a male calf or bull-calf. In <s>04400704101000</s> a verb derived from <i>moschos</i>, meaning “make a bull-calf", is used.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>05800901300020</s>: A word or phrase for a female calf (heifer) is the best equivalent. For “wild ox” see <l target="FAUNA:2.34">2.34 Wild ox</l>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0114_red_deer"/>There were once three different types of deer (family <i>cervidae</i>) in Canaan the Fallow Deer <i>Dama dama</i>, the Red Deer <i>Cervus elaphus</i>, and the Roe Deer <i>Capreolus capreolus</i>. Of these the red deer disappeared very early before the time of the Exodus and the roe deer was confined to thick bush in remote valleys and so was probably seldom seen. Thus the fallow deer would have been the most common. It roamed wild and was also probably kept in deer parks in the days of King Solomon.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew term <i>’ayal</i> was probably a general term for deer and for the male fallow deer in particular. <i>’Ayalah</i> and <i>’ayelet</i> are the female forms.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>At the time when <a>KJV</a> was produced deer hunting was a very popular pastime and a number of specialized words were used to refer to deer in their different stages of development. Young male deer were called successively: knobbers - brockets - spayads - staggards - harts - stags. The English word “hart” thus actually refers to a male red deer in its fifth year when a “royal” prong forms on its antler. The word “stag” refers to the male red deer (usually the dominant male of a herd) after its sixth year when a “crown” of three prongs forms at the very top of its antlers. “Hind” refers to the female red deer of three years and upward. “Buck” refers to the male fallow deer or the male roe deer and “doe” to the females of these. This usage is reflected in the <a>KJV</a><a>RSV</a> and <a>NEB</a> versions.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In modern English outside of deer-hunting circles most types of deer of either sex are called simply “deer” but if the sex is differentiated in most of the English-speaking world “stag” is usually used for the male and “doe” for the female; however, in the U.S.A. the males are called “bucks.” Young deer are often called “fawns."</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Deer differ from antelopes in that the males drop their antlers (horns) every year, while antelopes do not. Most deer have horns that branch, that is, they have more than one point on each horn. Only male deer have antlers, whereas in many antelope species both the males and females produce horns.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0212_fallow_deer"/>Fallow deer are fairly large animals standing about a meter (3 feet) high at the shoulder. In summer they have a reddish fur with white spots and in the winter this coat becomes darker and the spots disappear. The bucks begin to grow antlers (branching horns) in the second year. This is at first a short unbranched prong. Each year the antlers are shed at the beginning of spring. In the third year branched antlers appear with two simple branches facing forward and the main branch growing upward. In subsequent years this main branch grows bigger flattens out and develops numerous sharp points along the edge. Eventually at the end of the fifth year each antler is double the width of the human hand in places and about 70 centimeters (2 feet) in length.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Mating takes place in autumn when the bucks utter hoarse bellowing roars. Does do not have horns. They are very graceful creatures.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The male deer in Scripture is associated with speed agility and strength although in Song of Songs it is also associated with sexual prowess (as is the word stag in English). The female deer is associated with surefootedness and the ability to produce abundant offspring (from their second year they produce at least one fawn a year).</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Where deer are known, a generic word is the best choice. If no generic words exist but the fallow deer is known, the word for this deer should be chosen. In other parts of the world where deer are found, if a specific rather than a generic word has to be used, the word for a large type of deer is preferable, such as the sambar deer (of India, Burma, Thailand, and western China) or the elk of North America.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Since surefootedness is not associated with deer in some parts of the world, a phrase such as “surefooted as a deer” should be used in <s>01002203400012</s>, <s>01901803301000</s>, and <s>03500301900018</s> or a local animal known for its surefootedness could be substituted (see the discussion below).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In Africa, where the only deer are very small forest dwellers, it is better to use a term for an antelope that lives in herds, such as the impala, when there is a literal reference to deer. In passages where there is figurative usage, however, there is a little more leeway. In <s>01904200101000</s> for instance it would be legitimate to use the word for a local large antelope known to need water regularly, such as the wildebeest or impala. Similarly in the passages referred to above, where “surefootedness on high places” is the theme, the word for a local cliff-dwelling antelope such as the Klipspringer <i>Oreotragus oreotragus</i> or Chamois <i>Rupicapra rupicapra</i> would be legitimate. In all these cases a footnote could indicate that the Hebrew refers to a deer, although this is not strictly necessary. It is to be noted that in <s>01904200101000</s>, while the masculine form <i>’ayal</i> is used, the corresponding verb is feminine. Where a language distinguishes between genders, it is recommended that a word be used indicating a female animal.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the Hebrew text of <s>00104902100004</s> there are a number of problems. The combination of words used with the noun <i>’ayalah</i> is rather strange, since the sentence with the vowels of the Masoretic Text is literally “Naphtali is a female deer that has been sent/set free, which gives a beautiful word.” The verb “sent” is usually used of sending messengers, and the expression “a beautiful word” reinforces this possibility. The sentence could conceivably mean “Naphtali is like a deer sent out as a messenger to give beautiful news.” The point of comparison would be the speed of the deer, that is, it would describe Naphtali as a speedy messenger, which is rather strange. No major translation has ever adopted this interpretation.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Many translations have adopted the interpretation “Naphtali is a deer set free, which produces beautiful fawns” (compare <a>RSV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>TEV</a>, <a>NAB</a>), but this involves a very debatable emendation of the word meaning “word” or “utterance". The point of comparison would be enjoyment of freedom on the one hand and fertility on the other. It is likely that the Masoretic Hebrew text has been corrupted at some point, and that the Greek of the Septuagint represents an earlier form of the text: “Naphtali is a spreading terebinth tree that puts forth a lovely canopy” (compare <a>NEB</a>, <a>REB</a>, and footnotes in most other versions). This translation is based on a reading of <i>’elah</i> instead of <i>’ayalah</i>. The point of comparison for both metaphors would be prosperity and fertility. A similar problem exists in <s>01902900900008</s>, where the reading should probably be <i>’elah</i>, “terebinth tree", rather than <i>’ayalah</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In parts of the world where neither deer nor antelope are found, borrowed terms may have to be used, but these should be described in a glossary.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0184_dogs"/>Dogs were domesticated very early and were used for hunting and as watchdogs in the ancient world. In Egypt as early as 4000 B.C. people made pottery images that indicate that sleek fast hunting dogs were bred which looked like the modern greyhound. From Babylonian sculpture we know that around 2500 B.C. large hunting dogs that looked like the modern bull-mastiff were kept by people in the Mesopotamian civilizations.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0031_dog"/>Among the Jews however while dogs were kept mainly as watch-dogs they were held in contempt and left to feed themselves by scavenging. This habit of scavenging and the fact that dogs were possibly associated with some Egyptian gods meant that dogs were seen as very unclean animals by the Jews. The dog found in Jewish settlements in Bible times was probably the pariah dog <i>Canis familiaris putiatini</i> which looked something like a small light brown Alsatian or German shepherd. This type of dog in its wild and domesticated forms is found all over the Middle East and on the mainland coasts of South and Southeast Asia (where it is known as the crab-eating dog). The Australian dingo is also very similar.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Small pet dogs were kept in homes in the Greek and Roman civilizations by gentiles but not by Jews. This is probably the type of dog referred to by the Greek word <i>kunarion</i> in <s>04001502600032</s> and <s>04100702700040</s>.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>As mentioned above dogs were held in contempt as unclean. To call someone a dog was therefore very derogatory and to refer to someone as a “dead dog” was even more so. Israelites viewed dogs as second only to pigs as unclean animals. Dogs as scavengers around the villages ate anything from household refuse to animal carcasses and human excreta. They even ate human corpses that lay unburied after battles. Furthermore the dog was possibly one of the symbols of the Egyptian god Anubis (although many modern scholars believe the symbol to be the jackal).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>With all of the above in mind it is understandable that dying and then being eaten by unclean dogs was seen as the worst of all possible fates.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the first century A.D. gentiles were considered to be unclean and were referred to by Jews in a derogatory way as “dogs.” There is therefore strong irony in the expression in <s>05000300200006</s> where Judaizing Christians are referred to as dogs.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>One additional connotation associated with dogs in the Bible is sexual perversion and promiscuity a connotation probably arising from the fact that sexually aroused male dogs do not always differentiate between sexes as they seek to mate and the fact that dogs of both sexes mate repeatedly with different partners.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In <s>00201100700016</s> the literal expression “Not a dog shall move its tongue” means that not a single dog will bark or growl, and the expression should be so translated.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>00502301801000</s> male prostitutes associated with Canaanite temples are called “dogs", and in <s>06602201500006</s> sexual perverts or promiscuous people seem to be meant by the expression. In both these verses a literal translation will miss the point, so it is better to use terms such as “male temple prostitutes” in the first case and “people with uncontrolled sexual behavior” in the second.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>01000300800026</s> the expression “a dog’s head of Judah” is taken by some commentators as a reference to the sacred dog-mask worn by an Egyptian priest of the god Anubis, and thus to mean something like “a man of Judah in disguise", that is, “a spy from Judah". Other commentators take it to refer to the promiscuity associated with dogs, and thus to mean something like “a lusting man from Judah". In the context either is possible, and it is probable that both connotations are present and that the phrase means “a lusting spy from Judah".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01803000100030</s>: “Dogs of my flock” refers to watchdogs that helped guard sheep.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02306600300020</s>: The clause “He who sacrifices a lamb is like him who breaks a dog’s neck” should be understood as meaning that because of the disobedience of the people mentioned in verse 4, even if they offer an acceptable sacrifice such as a lamb, it is the same as offering the most unacceptable and unclean of sacrifices. The “breaking of a dog’s neck” is an unacceptable sacrifice on two counts: the dog is an unclean animal, and breaking its neck is the wrong way to kill any sacrifice, since the blood then remains in the carcass and defiles it according to Jewish law.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>05000300200006</s> it is almost impossible to capture the irony of referring to Christians who are overly concerned with ritual purity and circumcision as <b>dogs</b>. If dogs in the receptor culture are not viewed as especially unclean, then an expression such as “dirty dogs” should be used.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0615_manatee"/>This animal is only mentioned in Scripture with regard to the leather made from its skin. It is clear that its hide made very good leather. The <a>KJV</a> “badger” and <a>RSV</a> “goat” are almost certainly mistranslations. <a>NEB</a> ’s “porpoise” has more support since an Arabic word very similar to the Hebrew refers to the porpoise or dolphin. However catching sufficient porpoises to make a covering for the tabernacle would have been problematic for the Israelites since these animals live entirely in the sea while the Israelites were not a seagoing nation.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However, some local Bedouin tribes that live near the sea have for centuries made sandals and other articles from the skins of an animal called dugong and many modern scholars interpret <i>tachash</i> as referring to this animal. <a>NIV</a> and <a>NEB</a> (margin) have “sea cow". The dugong, which swims slowly and feeds on underwater weeds near the shore, is fairly easy to catch in nets.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The Dugong (<i>Dugong dugong</i>) is a large animal about 3 meters (10 feet) long, which lives in the sea, usually in small herds of twelve to fifteen animals. They swim slowly and feed in fairly shallow water on underwater weeds near mouths of rivers. They sometimes even move a short distance up the river. They need to come to the surface every few minutes to breathe, and they sometimes come out of the water to lie on rocks or sandbanks.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Although they have flippers rather than legs and a tail that looks like that of a large fish dugongs are mammals. They have soft fur. They do not lay eggs but give birth to babies and feed them on milk from their breasts. They are found in fairly large numbers even today in the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea and are also found along the tropical coasts of East Africa, South Asia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Australia and the Solomon Islands. They have also been reported in Taiwan.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0795_seal"/>Dugongs are distantly related to seals. They are pale gray in color and the male has small tusks in its upper jaw. They are harmless and unsuspicious animals and are easy to catch. Dugong skins are fairly thick soft and long-wearing and make high quality leather. The fur is usually left on the leather.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Three very similar animals are the Senegal Manatee <i>Trichechus senegalensis</i>, which is found in West Africa, the Caribbean Manatee <i>Trichechus manatus</i>, which is found on the coasts and in the lagoons of the Caribbean islands and Florida, and the South American Manatee <i>Trichechus inunguis</i>, which is found in the Amazon and Orinoco rivers.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Where dugongs and manatees are known, the best choice will be the word for one of the three mentioned in the previous paragraph. In areas where they are not known, the word for the seal can be used. Where seals are also not known, a more general expression such as “good soft leather” or “furs” is better than trying to name the animal. It is the skin rather than the animal that is in focus in all cases.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0536_indian_elephant"/>Although the first definite reference to elephants in the Bible is in the Greek deuterocanonical book of 1 Maccabees, ivory (literally “tooth") is mentioned first in the time of Solomon. By this date there were already ivory trade routes from the Sudan down the Nile and by sea from where Djibouti is now on the African Red Sea coast to where Eilat is now on the Gulf of Aqaba. Some of the ivory may have been made from the teeth of the hippopotamus but two references, <s>01101002200048</s> and <s>01400902100044</s>, specifically refer to elephant ivory (literally “elephant’s tooth"). Ivory was probably known even much earlier than this since ornaments dating from around 2300 B.C. have been found in Palestine.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Indian Elephant <i>Elephas maximus</i> was domesticated and trained for use in war very early well before the second millennium B.C. When Alexander the Great extended his empire into India in the fourth century B.C. he obtained war elephants to incorporate into his army. The idea of using elephants in war then spread to the Middle East. There was a smaller variety of this elephant found in Syria and Mesopotamia. By the third century B.C. domestic Indian elephants had been introduced into Egypt. Ptolemy II is reported to have had ninety-six elephants, four to a chariot, and later that same century when Ptolemy IV defeated the Seleucid king of Syria, Antiochus III, he is reported to have captured Syrians’ elephants. However, the Seleucid kings continued to use war elephants, and the next king, Epiphanes, attacked Egypt with elephants. He and his son then used them in their campaign against the Jews. According to 1Maccabees each elephant with thirty-two soldiers mounted on it, besides the Indian handler went into battle ahead of one thousand Syrian soldiers and five hundred horsemen. One of Maccabeus’ brothers was able to kill the largest elephant by getting under it and stabbing it, but he was himself killed when the elephant fell on him. At a later time probably because the Indian elephants were difficult to obtain the African Elephant <i>Loxodonta africana</i> was tamed for use in war. Coins show that the elephants used by the Roman Emperor Hadrian to cross the Alps were African probably brought from North Africa. See also <l target="FAUNA:7.1">7.1 Behemoth</l>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Elephas</i> is the word most commonly used in the deuterocanonical books although <i>elephantarchēs</i> which means commander of an elephant squadron is used in <s>07801401200014</s> and <s>07900500400006 L07900504500006</s>, and <i>thērion</i> which means “monster” is used in <s>07801502000038 L07801502100034</s>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0011_africanelephant"/>Elephants are the largest land animals on earth, the males of the Indian species being about 3 meters (10 feet) in height and weighing almost 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds). The African species is about half a meter (20 inches) higher and weighs up to 6,000 kilograms (13,200 pounds). The elephant’s trunk is basically an elongated nose, but it has muscles that make it a very useful feature. With it the elephant can not only smell but can pull down branches to eat, pick berries off bushes, draw up water to squirt into its mouth or over its body, and can use it as a weapon. On either side of the trunk the males grow long tusks that are often over 2 meters (6 feet) in length. These are used for digging up roots, gouging bark off trees, and lifting logs. These tusks are made of ivory. Elephants have large ears, which they use to fan themselves.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>They are a dark gray color and have no fur. Their body looks almost hairless but in fact they are covered with bristly hairs. They feed on vegetation such as leaves roots shoots bark and fruit.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>There are local words for elephant in most African, Middle Eastern, and Asian languages, and many international languages use a word derived from the Greek name <i>elephas</i>. In some areas even though there are no elephants, the fossilized bones of mammoths, the ancient relative of the elephant, are known, and this local name is used for modern elephants too. In most other areas the word for elephant is a word that is borrowed from the dominant language of the area. Where this language is English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, or Dutch, the word is similar to <i>elephant, elefant, elefantos</i>, or <i>olifant</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0256_gazelle"/>Both the Hebrew and Greek names are probably general terms for gazelle. At least two types of gazelle the Dorcas Gazelle <i>Gazella dorcas</i> and the Palestine or Arabian Gazelle <i>Gazella arabica</i> were found in the Middle East. They are still to be found in secluded areas. The gazelles pictured on the Ashurbanipal hunting panels are undoubtedly Impala <i>Aepyceros melampus</i> as can be seen from both the shape of the horns and the fact that the females are without horns. This would indicate that about 650 B.C. the impala was found as far east as Nineveh.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Gazelles are small to medium sized plains antelopes, inhabiting savannah plains and semideserts. Both sexes have horns, except for the female impala, which is without horns. The horns of the gazelle species mentioned above are lyre-shaped about 25-50 centimeters (10-20 inches) in length. Gazelles are reddish brown with almost white underparts. They are long-legged and graceful and are expert jumpers. They live in small herds of up to about thirty. Females become sexually active at one year and bear young every year. This high rate of reproduction ensures their survival. They feed on both grass and the leaves of acacia and other bushes.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A breeding herd consists of one dominant breeding male and a group of females. The other males are chased from the herd when they become sexually active and they then form bachelor herds. These bachelor herds are the prime target for human and animal hunters since they provide a convenient source of meat while leaving the breeding cycle intact. In biblical times gazelles were trapped in nets or snares or were shot with bows and arrows.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The gazelle was seen as the cleanest of game animals since it met all the requirements of the Law concerning cloven hooves and cud-chewing. It was also a symbol of speed grace and beauty (the Hebrew root means beauty) and of female sexuality and fertility.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In East Africa where gazelles are well known, a generic word for gazelles or the specific word for one of the smaller gazelles, such as the Thompson’s Gazelle <i>Gazella thompsonii</i>, is suitable. Elsewhere in Africa where the impala is known, the word for this antelope can be used.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Elsewhere, the word for a small antelope or deer that lives in herds can be used for the references that are literal, and the word for some swift, graceful antelope or deer can be used in the contexts where speed, grace, or beauty are being symbolized. As usual, in areas where gazelles, antelopes, and deer are unknown, a transliteration from the dominant international language or from the Hebrew original can be used. In such cases a description should be given in the glossary.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><i>Tsafir</i> is an Aramaic or late Hebrew word appearing in Scripture in which were among the last books to be added to the Old Testament canon. It refers to the male goat, possibly to a castrated male.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Sa‘ir</i> is used mostly in Leviticus and refers to goats as sacrificial animals. It literally means “hairy one” and may refer to the type of goat bred for its hair (see description below). <i>Sa‘ir</i> refers to a male goat with <i>se‘irah</i> being the feminine form.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Goats are fairly small animals with hooves. They were domesticated very early in the Middle East. Both longhaired and shorthaired breeds were known, the former being raised for its hair, and the latter for its milk, meat, and skin. The shorthaired type was probably the Nubian Goat <i>Capra hircus mambrica</i>, a floppy-eared breed with black and white, or brown and white, patches. The longhaired breed was also floppy-eared, of the Angora type, <i>Capra hircus angorensis</i>. It was usually black with long silky fur.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Three passages in the Bible seem to liken this hair to human hair: <s>02200400100032</s>, <s>02200600500024</s>, and <s>00901901300032</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Goats were very important to the early Israelites. Like sheep they were a source of meat, milk, hides, hair, and horns. They prefer to browse on leaves and shoots rather than graze and thus do not compete with sheep for the grass in fact they can survive on desert shrubs even where there is no grass. They are excellent survivors of drought or desert conditions.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Goats were herded together with sheep although sheep were more numerous. Goats were actually quite helpful to the shepherds. While sheep are very dependent on each other lacking in self-confidence and thus tending to bunch together closely goats move about confidently in scattered groups following the general lead of a dominant male. When sheep and goats are herded together the goats feed on the shrubs on the slopes or edges of the valleys while the sheep keep to the grass on the more level areas. The goats scatter and the sheep follow their lead and thus graze in a more scattered pattern when with goats with all benefiting from the less dense grazing.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0267_goats_herd"/>The goats also have a better sense of direction and since the sheep follow the goats there is less likelihood of sheep getting lost. At dusk the goats will automatically start heading for their home behind their leader and the sheep follow them making the task easier for the shepherd.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The meat of adult male goats has a strong flavor and smell and is usually avoided. However killing female goats is not a good policy as they are the reproducers. So even in Bible times young goats (kids) usually male were killed for food. It is also possible that castrated male goats were kept for butchering.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Goat hair was used to make tents and warm coats and for stuffing pillows and saddles.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The floppy-eared goats of the Middle East are not as easy to differentiate from sheep as other types of goat may be. Hence separating sheep from goats had to be done carefully.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>While goats were a good source of food and clothing material in ancient Middle Eastern folk religions they were also associated with demons. In three passages especially this association is prominent. Two of them are discussed below. The third is <s>00301600501000-00301602801000</s>, where the goat chosen by lot as being “for Azazel” is sent away into the desert. Azazel was the name of the goat-demon of the wilderness. He is not being worshiped in this passage but the sins of Israel are being sent to him.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>‘atud</i> which refers to the dominant male leader of a flock of goats was also used for a human leader in much the same way as “shepherd".</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In languages where goats are unknown, a borrowed word or a transliterated form is usually used. Elsewhere the normal word for goat should be used. When both <i>‘ez</i> and another word for goat appear in the same context, <i>‘ez</i> should be translated as “female goat". Similarly when both <i>sa‘ir</i> and another word for goat appear in the same context, <i>sa‘ir</i> should be translated as male goat.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Except for the Jeremiah and Zechariah passages mentioned below, <i>‘atud</i> should be translated as “large male goat", “lead-goat", or “stud-goat".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00301700701000</s>: The verse is referring to the heathen sacrifice of animals to goat-demons, rather than to goats. The use of “satyr” in some English translations is unfortunate, as this term reflects Greek beliefs from a much later period of history. The term goat-demon is to be preferred.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01401101501000</s>: In this verse the wording is literally “priests for the high places and for the goats and for the calves which he had made.” It is clear that the “goats” were man-made, as were the shrines and the calves. In other words the meaning is “priests to serve the hill-shrines and the idols of goats and calves which he had made."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02301302101030 H02303401400014</s>: In both these passages the other animals mentioned are all wild animals associated with desolate or ruined towns. It seems likely that in such towns there would be surviving goats living like wild animals in the absence of human shepherds. What is literally “goats” in these passages should probably be translated “feral goats” or “wild goats". In some languages expressions for such animals include “rubbish goats", “goats turned wild", “bush goats", or “forest goats".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02405104000018</s> and <s>03801000301000</s>: In these verses, where <i>‘atud</i> occurs, it should be translated as “leader of the flock” or something similar.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In all other passages the regular word for goat can be used.</Paragraph>

Kids of both male and female sexes were used for this purpose since the meat of male goats only acquired its strong smell when the goats became sexually active.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In Hebrew the word <i>gedi</i> is often used together with other words for goats, such as <i>‘ez</i>, in expressions like <i>gedi ‘izim</i>, literally “a kid of goats” This longer expression means exactly the same as the single word <i>gedi</i>. In all cases a specific word or a phrase for a young goat or baby goat can be used. See the illustration in the previous entry.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0284_hare"/>Hares and rabbits both belong to the same zoological family of <i>Leporidae</i>. In the land of Israel and Egypt there are several species of hare, the most common being a subspecies of the European Brown Hare, <i>Lepus europaeus</i>, the Arabian Hare <i>Lepus arabicus</i>, and the African Hare, <i>Lepus capensis</i>. Hares and rabbits were classified as rodents until the 1950s along with mice rats and squirrels. They are now classified as “lagomorphs” since true rodents have enamel only on the front side of their long front teeth (incisors) while hares and rabbits have enamel on both sides.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Hares are found naturally in virtually every part of the world except Australasia where the European Rabbit <i>Oryctolagus cumiculus</i> was introduced. The main obvious differences between hares and rabbits are a) rabbits live in burrows they make themselves while hares do not although they may temporarily occupy holes made by other animals and b) rabbits live in family groups while hares are mainly solitary.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the Law of Moses hares are forbidden food because “they chew the cud but do not have cloven hooves.” In fact hares do not chew cud but they certainly often look as if they are doing so. Among some species of hare there is a phenomenon called “refection” which has a result something like the chewing of cud in that it involves chewing the same food twice. Among these hares two different types of dropping are produced. One type consisting of partially digested food is eaten by the hares. Some writers have suggested that this is what is referred to by the biblical expression “chewing the cud". However this phenomenon has not been seen among Middle Eastern hares.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The prohibition is strictly a religious or ritual one as hares are an important food in many countries. There is nothing particularly “unclean” about hares. Their habits are certainly no less clean than those of goats.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Hares are smallish, light brown animals about half a meter (20 inches) long, with long ears and short fluffy tails. They have long hind legs and are good jumpers. They hide during the day and come out to feed on vegetation at night.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Since hares and rabbits are found all over the world, there is usually no difficulty in finding a suitable local word. In the United States and Canada, where both rabbits and hares are found, if a specific word has to be chosen rather than a general one, the jack rabbit, or the snowshoe rabbit, would be a better choice than the cottontail rabbit, since both of the former are actually hares.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0305_horse"/>Horses belong to an animal family that includes donkeys and zebras. They were first domesticated in the central Asian and Mongolian grasslands, the original home of the eastern wild horse, sometime before 2000 B.C. (The European wild horse was domesticated considerably later.) By 1700 B.C. horses had been imported into Canaan and Egypt. The fact that horses were imported made them very expensive, and for centuries horses were only owned by kings and wealthy local chiefs. Their military potential was soon recognized, and armies that were equipped with war chariots and had soldiers on horseback had an enormous advantage over those that did not. Horses gave armies a mobility they had never had before, and completely changed battle tactics.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In more recent times, horses have been carried abroad by European colonists and introduced to virtually every country on earth. The so-called “wild horses” of Spain, France, the Americas, and Australia are actually domesticated horses that have returned to their wild state.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Joseph, in <s>00104701700028</s> (the first mention of horses in the Bible), used the widespread famine and Egypt’s store of grain as an opportunity to obtain horses for the Pharaoh. He thus weakened the neighboring tribes, while giving Pharaoh’s army better military capability. It is ironic that these horses were later used against Israelites under Moses.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Canaanites also had horses and chariots, but in <s>00501701600010</s> the people of Israel were prohibited from acquiring horses, as this was seen as weakening their reliance on God. Militarily they were thus at a considerable disadvantage in their wars against the Canaanite tribes. They counteracted this disadvantage by concentrating on fighting in the hill country, or occasionally in swampy land (<s>00700400701000 H00700501901000 H00700502001000 H00700502101000</s>), where chariots were useless. They cut the hamstring tendon at the back of the hind legs on captured horses, rendering them useless to both Canaanites and themselves (<s>00601100900022</s>). Even so, <s>00700101901000</s> states that “Judah drove out the inhabitants of the mountains, but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valleys because they had iron chariots” (<a>NIV</a>; compare also <a>TEV</a> and <a>REB</a>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Joshua, Saul, and David seem to have heeded the warning not to acquire horses. However, David finally gave in to the temptation, and in <s>01000800401000</s> we read that although he hamstrung most of the captured horses, he kept a hundred for himself. The advantage that he gained was later turned against him when two of his sons, Absalom (<s>01001500100024</s>) and Adonijah (<s>01100100501000</s>), equipped themselves with horses from David’s stables in preparation for their revolts against him.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However, it was Solomon who made horses and chariots a major component of the Israelite army. He imported horses from Egypt and Cilicia at a cost of 150 shekels each, and he received horses as part of the annual tax paid to him by smaller states. He eventually collected 12,000 horses, which were stabled in a number of towns (<s>01101002601000</s> ff.).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Most horses in Bible times were probably very different from today’s riding or workhorses. They were smaller, with shorter heads and thicker necks, and probably had fairly thick hair in winter. They would have been similar in appearance to the Przewalski’s horses <i>Equus caballus przewalskii</i>, which can be seen in some zoo parks.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In the Bible the horse is symbolic of military might, and the hardness and durability of its hooves are especially referred to. Horses also acquired some religious significance and were associated with the sun, which was said to ride across the sky in a chariot. Some of the idolatrous kings of Judah apparently made images of horses dedicated to the sun (<s>01202301100010</s>) and placed them in the Temple, from where they were removed by Josiah.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Since horses have been exported to almost every country in the world, there is usually no problem in finding a word, even though it may be borrowed from a dominant language of the region. It is best to make a gender distinction between male and female horses in <s>02200100900004</s> (female) and, if the less likely exegesis “stallion” is followed, in <s>02405001101000</s> (male). Stallions neigh and fight each other to establish which is dominant, especially when they are in the presence of mares. This is what is possibly referred to in the Jeremiah passage.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>’abir</i> literally means “mighty ones” and possibly could be a reference to exceptionally big, strong stallion war-horses, of the kind called “chargers” or “steeds” in archaic English. In many languages it will be best translated by a phrase meaning something like “fierce horse", or with a more figurative phrase such as “warrior horse” or “chief horse". In <s>02405001101000</s> the fact that this is a male horse is important, since this verse refers to the uncontrollable nature of stallions, especially when in the presence of female horses and other stallions.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>sus</i> and <i>hippos</i> are the general words for horse in the Old and New Testaments respectively. In the Old Testament the feminine form <i>susah</i> occurs once, in <s>02200100900004</s>. See also <l target="FAUNA:3.23">3.23 Swift, swallow</l> for discussion of another meaning for <i>sus</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>parash</i>, which occurs over fifty times, normally refers to a war-horse and its rider as a single military unit, a mounted trooper. In the plural it usually means cavalry or a mounted battalion. (A similar usage is to be found in some of the deuterocanonical references to <i>hippos</i>, which is also the word used in the Septuagint to translate <i>parash</i>.) <a>NAB</a> and <a>NIV</a> (the latter in footnotes) take it to mean “charioteers". This word is best translated as “soldiers on horses” in most passages, with the exception of <s>01100402601000</s> and <s>01400902500016</s>, where cavalry horses seem to be referred to, without reference to the riders. In these two passages there is a difference in numbers. In the Hebrew text <s>01100402601000</s> refers to 40,000 stables, and <s>01400902500016</s> to 4,000 stables. In the Septuagint both passages have 4,000. There are a number of possible interpretations.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01100402601000</s>: The rendering of <a>NAB</a> (similarly <a>JB</a>), “Solomon had four thousand stalls for twelve thousand chariot horses,” involves an inconsistent translation of <i>parash</i>, which is not, and cannot be, translated as “chariot horse” in the parallel passage in <s>01400902500016</s>. It appears that this unusual translation in turn is the result of opting for the figure four thousand. If the forty thousand of the Hebrew text were accepted, there would then be forty thousand stalls for chariot horses, but only twelve thousand horses!</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><a>NIV</a> tries to avoid this pitfall with “Solomon had four thousand stalls for chariot horses, and twelve thousand horses.” However, this actually also equates <i>parash</i> with “chariot horse", which it does not and cannot do in <s>01300902501000</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><a>RSV</a> has “Solomon also had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.” This translation of <i>parash</i> is consistent, but it ignores the difference in context. The narrator would then be counting stables and horsemen in the same phrase, which is highly unlikely.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The majority of commentaries and the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project (<a>HOTTP</a>) accept the Hebrew text (forty thousand) as the better text for this verse. This is reflected by <a>TEV</a> ’s “Solomon had forty thousand stalls for his chariot horses and twelve thousand cavalry horses” (compare <a>NEB</a>, <a>REB</a>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Since <i>parash</i> refers in different contexts to (a) war-horses and their riders, (b) only the riders, or (c) only the war-horses, this translation as cavalry horses is consistent. An option would be “war-horses” or “horses for war". The Hebrew text seems, on the surface, to give forty thousand as the number of stables, but it is possible that the writer intended to indicate the number of horses stabled there.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The <a>NIV</a> footnote, “charioteers", for <i>parash</i> has very little support.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01300902501000</s>: The generally accepted exegesis of this verse is “Solomon had four thousand outbuildings for his chariots and horses, and had twelve thousand cavalry horses” (compare <a>TEV</a>, <a>NEB</a>, <a>REB</a>). This rendering accepts an inconsistency between <s>01100402601000</s> and <s>01300902501000</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A solution, which is defensible, and which avoids the inconsistency, is to follow the <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> rendering for <s>01100402601000</s> “stables for forty thousand chariot horses,” and the <a>TEV</a> rendering of <s>01400902500016</s> “four thousand stalls,” since it is possible to house forty thousand horses in four thousand stables. However, this solution would involve translating two very similar Hebrew phrases in two different ways.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>rekesh</i> is best translated as “fast horse", or “best horse". <s>01700801000046 H01700801400010</s> indicate that this word refers to a horse that was selectively bred and apparently particularly swift, and so especially suited to carrying messengers. There are scholars who trace the modern Arabian breed of horse back to the ancient <i>rekesh</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>03300101300012</s>: The context in this verse is one of haste, and the writer is calling on the people of Lachish to hitch to their chariots their fastest horses, perhaps usually reserved for the nobility to ride.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0309_striped_hyena"/>The word <i>tsavu‘a</i> occurs only twice in the Bible one of them being in the phrase <i>‘ayit tsavu‘a</i> (<s>02401200900006</s>). The word <i>‘ayit</i> is usually taken to mean a screamer and in <s>00101501101000</s> it is obviously a bird hence the interpretation “bird of prey” (see <l target="FAUNA:3.8">3.8 Eagle vulture</l>). <i>tsavu‘a</i> is taken to mean “speckled blotched". Thus the “speckled screamer” is taken by some scholars to mean “speckled bird of prey” (<a>RSV</a><a>NIV</a>) and by others to mean “hyena” (<a>REB</a><a>NEB</a>). However, there are also scholars who relate <i>‘ayit</i> to a different Hebrew root that means “to attack greedily” and take <i>‘ayit</i> to mean “prey” or even “carrion". These latter scholars interpret <i>‘ayit tsavu‘a</i> to mean “prey for hyenas” or “carrion for hyenas” (compare <a>NAB</a>, New Revised Standard Version). It is recommended that this exegesis be followed. Another possible rendering of the phrase could even be a place of scavenging hyenas.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There is considerable doubt about the meaning of the Hebrew word <i>tsiyim</i> and different translations have marmots, wild animals, wild cats, desert animals and even sharks and dolphins. It is clear that the word refers to a specific dangerous wild animal (possibly which lives in the desert) often associated with destruction and with jackals. Although not mentioned at all in the English versions there are many scholars zoologists among them who interpret this word as referring to the hyena.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The uncertainty surrounding the word relates to the fact that nobody is sure what other Hebrew words <i>tsiyim</i> is related to. Some relate it to a word for “desert", thus “desert creature". This interpretation does not exclude the hyena and in fact since the references seem to be to a specific animal rather than to desert animals in general the contexts would all fit “hyena” well. The trend among scholars today is to associate it with a word that disappeared early from Hebrew meaning “to wail or yelp". The fairly obvious conclusion from this would be that the word means “the wailer", that is the hyena.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The translations “shark", “dolphin” and “marmot” can be dismissed as very doubtful, especially “marmot", which is an animal that lives in high mountain environments and has never lived in the land of Israel.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Striped Hyena <i>Hyaena hyaena</i> has been a very well-known and common animal in the Middle East since time immemorial. One would expect to find references to it in the Bible.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Hyenas emerge at night from holes and hollows under logs. They are best known as scavengers. They eat carcasses and bones of all kinds and forage in refuse dumps around cities, towns, and villages. However, they also hunt and are opportunistic, killing young goats, sheep, and baby gazelles. They often occupy abandoned houses or tombs.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Their weird calls at night vary from loud whoops and howls when they mark territory and contact family members to moans when they chase away rival scavengers and to yelps and wails when they are frightened away by humans or other predators.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The striped hyena is also found in northeast Africa the Arabian Peninsula and India. Like all hyena species it looks like a big dog with a large head. Its front legs are longer than its back legs and it has a stiff upright mane that stretches from between its ears all the way down its back to the end of its tail. It is a brownish gray color with dark indistinct stripes that become spots and blotches on its neck.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Since we cannot be one hundred percent sure that <i>tsiyim</i> refers to hyenas neither can we be sure of the connotations of the word. However from what is known about hyenas and their significance to other Semitic peoples we can draw some conclusions. As scavengers that eat carcasses hyenas thrive in times of famine or war. They are thus associated with both types of catastrophe. Their weird noises at night are often associated with demons and stories abound of ghosts that return in the form of hyenas. And finally probably because they are known to eat human corpses that have not been properly buried most people view them with repugnance. Anywhere in the Middle East to call someone a hyena is a terrible insult.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>A different, but very similar species of hyena, the Spotted Hyena <i>Crocuta crocuta</i>, is found throughout eastern, central, and southern Africa. Another species, the Brown Hyena <i>Hyaena brunnea</i>, is found in southwestern Africa. In these areas, therefore, a word for hyena will be easy to find. In most Bantu languages in these areas, the word for hyena is related either to <i>fisi</i> (<i>fitsi, pisi</i>, and other forms) or to <i>bere</i> (<i>mbere, mvere</i>, and other forms).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In areas where some kind of wild scavenging dog or wolf is known, the name for this animal can be used. Elsewhere one may use a phrase like “wild dog” or a transliteration and give a fuller description in the glossary or word list.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The place called “Valley of <i>Tsevo‘im</i> in <s>00901301800042</s> means “The Valley of Hyenas", and can either be translated as such, or the name can be transliterated from Hebrew.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01907200900008</s>: In this difficult verse the word <i>tsiyim</i> is used as a parallel to a word meaning “enemies". Thus, if “hyenas” was intended, it was as a metaphor for “enemies". The verse would then mean something like “His enemies [those hyenas] will bow before him; his foes will lick the dust.” Others, however, taking <i>tsiyim</i> to mean “desert creatures", understand this to be a metaphorical reference to desert tribes and interpret the text to mean “Desert tribes will bow before him; his enemies will lick the dust.” It is entirely possible that a word play was intended and that both meanings are included: “Desert tribes [those hyenas] will bow before him . . . ."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01907401400020</s>: A literal translation of the Hebrew would be:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>You crushed the heads of Leviathan,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>And gave him as food to people, to <i>tsiyim</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Most English translations render this as:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>You crushed the heads of Leviathan,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>And gave his carcass to desert creatures to eat.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However, very old Jewish traditions, which have this verse as their basis, tell how God will kill the monster Leviathan and then hold a feast for his people, with Abraham as the host. There will be so much meat from this huge animal that even after all the people are fed, they will have to throw away vast amounts of meat, which the hyenas will eat. This would indicate that from ancient times there have been people who have interpreted the repetition of the Hebrew prepositional phrase (see literal translation above) to mean “to [his] people and to hyenas."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02301302100008 H02301302201000</s>: In these verses there are four words for howling wild animals that inhabit deserted buildings: <i>tsiyim, ’ochim, ’iyim, tanim</i>. All except <i>tsiyim</i> probably mean “jackals"; however, to maintain the parallelism of the Hebrew poem, it is better to translate both <i>tsiyim</i> and <i>’iyim</i> as “hyenas":</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Wailing hyenas will settle there;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Howling jackals will fill their houses . . .</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Hyenas will wail in their fortresses,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>And jackals howl in their luxurious palaces.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02303401400006</s>: This verse probably should be interpreted as “Hyenas will meet with jackals . . . ."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02405003900006</s>: This probably should be interpreted as “Hyenas and jackals will live there . . . ."</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0310_hyrax"/>Coney: The seventeenth century English word “coney” was the common word at that time for the rabbit, “rabbit” being used at that time only for the baby rabbit. In later English “rabbit” came to be used for the adults as well. “Coney” then dropped out of use except among fur traders. However it is certain that the Hebrew word <i>shafan</i> does not mean “rabbit” so the <a>KJV</a> translation “coney” was incorrect. In the nineteenth century, Bible readers perhaps not being sure what a “coney” was, came to identify the “coney” with the Syrian hyrax, probably as the result of hearing preachers describe the animal. To these readers then “coney” acquired a new meaning that it had nowhere else. The <a>NIV</a> use of “coney” is thus both archaic and incorrect.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Badger</b>: Two types of badger live in the land of Israel. The more common is <i>Meles meles</i> and the second is the ratel or Honey Badger <i>Mellivora capensis</i>. The ratel eats anything from small mammals to lizards, insects, snails, fruit, honey and any dead animal or bird. But the animal referred to in <s>00301100500008</s> and <s>00501400700054</s> eats only vegetation and in <s>01910401800022</s> and <s>02003002600002</s> it is associated with rocks as its natural habitat. <i>Shafan</i> therefore cannot be the badger or the ratel. Thus those versions using “badger” are likewise incorrect.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Rock badger</b>: Mystery surrounds the name “rock badger". There was no known animal popularly called a “rock badger” prior to the release of the Brown, Driver, and Briggs translation of Gesenius’ Hebrew Lexicon in 1906. In this lexicon apparently for the first time, “rock badger” appears as the translation of the Hebrew <i>shafan</i>. It is unclear why they coined this new word in preference to the more common “rock rabbit", but it was probably the result of translating the Cape Dutch <i>klip dassie</i> ("little rock badger") too literally. However “rock badger” has been used by most English translators ever since. Both “coney” and “rock badger” are, however, not only basically meaningless to most readers but are also incorrect.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The animal referred to by the Hebrew word <i>shafan</i> is undoubtedly the Syrian Rock Hyrax <i>Procavia capensis syriaca</i>. This identification was first made by Canon Tristram in 1867 and has been confirmed many times since. It is a very common animal in the Middle East and Africa eats only vegetation and lives among the rocks.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In southern and eastern Africa other subspecies of the Hyrax <i>Procavia capensis</i> and the Yellow-spotted Hyrax <i>Heterohyrax brucei</i> are sometimes called “rock rabbit", but are more usually called by the Afrikaans name “dassie".</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Hyraxes are found only in the Middle East and Africa. They are the size of small rabbits, but there the similarity ends. Hyraxes are unique in many ways. They have small round ears, no visible tail, and short legs. They look a bit like giant guinea pigs or cane rats, but they are not really rodents. They live mainly on leaves and herbs. The structure of their jaws, teeth, and feet and the size of their prehistoric ancestors link them to the rhinoceros and elephant.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Two of their top front teeth develop into small tusks which sometimes protrude from the side of their mouth. They have four toes on their front feet and three on the back feet. These toes do not have claws but each has a small hoof-like nail. The soles of their feet are perpetually clammy, being lubricated by a special gland. This enables them to run up almost vertical rock faces and climb trees with ease. In the middle of their back they have another large gland covered with an oval patch of hairs of a different color. These hairs can be raised as an alarm signal.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>For such small mammals hyraxes have a very long gestation period of seven months. They live in fairly large family groups and since they are unable to regulate their body temperature by perspiring they huddle together in cavities under rocks when the weather is cold and lie stretched out in breezy locations in the shade of the rocks or trees when it is hot. They are thus only active and visible when the temperature is neither very hot nor cold.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>They are quite vocal creatures, communicating by a variety of grunts, whistle-like alarm squeals, and territory-marking barks.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Syrian rock hyrax is a fawny gray color with a yellowish back patch. Today they are easily seen in the wadis of the Judean Desert and in many parts of Galilee. They are also found in the Sinai, Arabian Peninsula, Syria and Lebanon.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>00301100500008</s> and <s>00501400700054</s> hyraxes are said to “chew the cud". This is not factually correct but they often look as if they are chewing endlessly. The reasons for them being declared “unclean” are strictly religious. As vegetation eaters they are no more a health hazard than for example goats or sheep. They actually spend a lot of time cleaning themselves.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Apart from being viewed as “unclean” animals there is one additional significance associated with the hyrax. Being virtually defenseless and easy prey for hawks, leopards, and human beings, the hyrax in <s>02000302601000</s> symbolizes a combination of defenselessness and wisdom. It is defenseless but wise enough to seek the protection of the rocks which in turn are symbolic of the timeless protective stability of God."</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Hyraxes are distributed over a wide area of eastern, western, central, and southern Africa. It is thus not usually difficult to find a word for hyrax in this region. In many eastern and southeastern Bantu languages the word for hyrax is <i>mbira, mbila, mpila</i>, or some similar derivative. It is usually classified in these languages as a type of rat.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Outside of the Middle East and Africa, however, it is difficult to find a word that will be both accurate and well known. Phrases such as “cliff rabbits” or “rock rabbits” are sometimes acceptable, but the best solution is probably to transliterate either the Hebrew word <i>shafan</i> or the scientific general name “hyrax", and to include a fuller description in a footnote or in a glossary.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the passages in Leviticus and Deuteronomy the translator is obliged to translate the writer’s view that the hyrax is a cud-chewing animal, even though this may not be factually correct.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0313_ibex"/>The wild goat found in the land of Israel is the Nubian Ibex <i>Capra ibex nubiana</i>. It has existed in the mountains of this region from time immemorial and until fairly recently it was a very common animal. It was and to some degree still is found in the mountainous parts of Israel the Sinai Peninsula Arabia and Egypt. A closely related species <i>Capra walie</i> is found in Ethiopia and Eritrea.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However the ibex is the only type of wild goat now found in Israel. One other type once lived there but disappeared in the Stone Age long before the time of Abraham. Both <i>ya‘el</i> and <i>’aqo</i> are the Hebrew names for this animal. Thus versions such as the <a>RSV</a><a>NIV</a><a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> which include two types of wild goat in the list of clean animals in <s>00501400500014</s> are probably not correct.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Nubian ibex is a fairly large wild goat, with adults being about ninety centimeters (3 feet) high at the shoulder. It is a grayish color for most of the year but turns browner in winter. Males have thick long horns over 130 centimeters (4 feet) in length which curve backwards in a semicircle. The horns of the females are much slimmer and shorter, reaching a length of only about 40 centimeters (15 inches). Only the last few centimeters of the horns are smooth, the rest being ringed with ridges. These ibexes live in small herds in the mountains and prefer cliffs and crags, where they live off the bushes that grow on the ledges. Ibex meat is moister and more tender than that of gazelle or deer, and they have been a favorite game animal for many centuries.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The “Wild Goat Rocks” mentioned in <s>00902400201000</s> is probably the rocky area around the pools and streams of Nahal Arugot near En Gedi. The area has been declared a nature reserve, and the ibexes and other indigenous animals are protected there. The name En Gedi itself, which means “Oasis of the Kid” or “Spring of the Kid", probably refers to a young ibex.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The ibex is closely associated with remote high mountains and in both Hebrew and Arabic culture it became viewed as the most remote of all animals (compare <s>01803900100010</s>). This is probably the reason why so many English translations render <i>ya‘el</i> as “mountain goat". Although not referred to in the Bible ibexes are also known for their surefootedness on rocky ledges.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However to both of the abovementioned cultures the female ibex was a symbol of grace and beauty grace being associated with the perfect balance with which ibexes stand walk and jump on the cliff faces and beauty probably being associated with their large human-like eyes. In English and many other cultures this poses a problem in <s>02000501900008</s>, because in these cultures goats are not positive symbols of beauty. In some Tibeto-Burman cultures the wild serow goat is viewed as the ugliest of all animals. In these languages to refer to a woman as a “wild goat” would be an insult. This is the reason why the English versions have “doe” rather than “wild goat".</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In the remaining countries where no indigenous wild goats are found, or where specific words for such do not exist, a phrase equivalent to wild goat or wild mountain goat is usually used. The latter expression is probably the better choice, because in West Africa particularly bush goat is the word for the duiker, a small antelope not associated with mountains.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0243_fox"/>In biblical times and even today there are three species of fox found in Israel and one type of jackal. An additional type of fox was found in Egypt. In the Bible the Hebrew word <i>shu‘al</i> and its Greek equivalent <i>alōpēx</i> refer to any of these animals. These are members of the same animal family which includes the wolf and the dog. The word “jackal” was borrowed from the Arabic <i>jakal</i> which is from the same Semitic root as the Hebrew word <i>shu‘al</i>. In the days of <a>KJV</a> the word “jackal” had not yet been introduced into the English language and so in that version “fox” is used throughout for <i>shu‘al</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Modern scholars are almost unanimous in agreeing that the word <i>’iyim</i> (plural of <i>’iy</i>) is derived from a root meaning “to howl” and that it refers to howling jackals in particular. The word usually occurs in conjunction with the word <i>tsiyim</i> ("hyenas") which is derived from a root meaning “to wail". The pair together could justifiably be interpreted as “wild animals wailing and howling.” This is usually taken to refer to hyenas and jackals.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The context will usually indicate which animal is being referred to in a particular passage. It is possible that the fox was known as the small <i>shu‘al</i> and the jackal as the large one.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In early Hebrew the plural form <i>tanin</i> from <i>tan</i> meant a type of snake. This usage is found in <s>00200700901000 H00200701001000 H00200701201000 H00503203301000 H01909101301000</s>. The same word was the name of a mythical monster or sea serpent. This usage occurs in <s>00100102101000 H01800701201000 H01907401301000 H01914800701000 H02302700101000 H02305100901000 H02405103401000 H02602900301000 H02603200201000</s>. However, it is well accepted now that, in later Hebrew, <i>tan</i> is a poetic name for the jackal. It derives from a stem meaning to recite, or lament. In the passages where snakes or the monster <i>tanin</i> is referred to the context usually indicates that it cannot refer to jackals. These passages are discussed further in <l target="FAUNA:4.9">4.9 Snake</l> and <l target="FAUNA:7.2">7.2 Dragon, sea monster</l>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0214_fennec"/><b>Fox</b>: All foxes look like small, longhaired dogs with pointed noses. The Red Fox <i>Vulpes vulpes</i> (also <i>Vulpes flavescens</i>) is now very common all over Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, China, Japan, North America, and Australasia, having been introduced into the latter two continents to be hunted on horseback with packs of dogs. The red fox is a smallish animal, about 1 meter (3 feet) from nose to tip of the tail. It is usually reddish with white underparts and a bushy tail. Red foxes feed mainly on mice and rats but also eat chickens, game birds, and fallen fruit. They may occasionally eat carrion (dead animals), but are not scavengers in the usual sense of the word.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Desert Fox <i>Vulpes ruppelli</i> and the Egyptian Fox <i>Vulpes nilotica</i> are slightly smaller and yellowish brown, but they are otherwise very similar to the red fox. The Fennec <i>Vulpes zerda</i> is a very small fox with large ears. It is now found in the Middle East and Egypt and was probably found in Israel also in earlier times. It feeds on insects and mice.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Foxes live in pairs, singly or in small family groups when they have young. During the day they live in holes in the ground usually dug by some other animal and come out at night to feed. When chased by dogs they are very clever at escaping, often doubling back on their tracks and then jumping sideways and heading in a new direction, thus confusing the scent trail. They also run up streams and thus avoid laying a scent trail altogether.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Jackal</b>: The jackal found in Israel is the Golden or Oriental Jackal <i>Canis aureus</i>. It is also sometimes referred to as the Indian jackal. This animal is larger than the fox. It is yellowish brown with black tips to the long fur on its back.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Jackals eat almost anything and are great opportunists moving very fast with clever tactics when they have to. They have been known to steal bread from people’s houses and baby animals even from dangerous wild pigs. They are scavengers, eating household rubbish as well as carrion, especially the remains of carcasses killed by lions, but they also eat beetles and birds’ eggs and kill small mammals game birds and domestic chickens and ducks.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In some of the literature there is reference to the fact that jackals live in packs. This is not strictly correct. They live in pairs or small family groups but they may associate temporarily in larger groups when many pairs are attracted to the same burrows, carrion, refuse dumps, or potential prey. In these larger temporary groups they may cooperate and act together like a pack.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0541_jackal"/>Jackals live in burrows made by other animals or in abandoned human houses or shelters and emerge to feed at night. They yap, howl, and wail at great length at the entrance to their burrow, especially on moonlit nights, with one pair triggering a response from neighboring pairs.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Both foxes and jackals are extremely intelligent animals, and their quick-witted, crafty opportunism is legendary in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. The fables of Aesop, a North African philosopher and storyteller, which feature the crafty fox, date from about the time of Daniel. The fox also figures in Greek and Roman fables. Similar fables about opportunistic jackals have been widespread in Africa and the Middle East for centuries.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In ancient Arabic literature and in the Talmud and Midrash the word “lion” stands for a truly great and powerful person. In contrast “jackal” is used to designate an insignificant but self-important person. Since this figurative usage of “lion” (or “lioness") is also common in the Bible there is a strong probability that the term “jackal” or “fox” used as a metaphor in the Bible for a person carries the connotation of self-important insignificance.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However the main symbolism associated with the jackal in the Bible is related to its habit of living among ruins and feeding on carcasses. To say that a certain place would become the dwelling place of jackals meant that the place would become deserted and lie in ruins, as the result of war. The jackal was thus a symbol of death and desolation as well as insignificance and opportunistic craftiness.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In areas where jackals are known, but not foxes, the word for jackal can be used for both. Similarly, if foxes are known but not jackals, the one word will suffice. In areas where neither foxes nor jackals are found, there may be related animals such as the Coyote <i>Canis latrans</i> or various types of wild dog or small wolf. In those few areas where even these are not found, one may use an expression such as “wild dog” or a transliteration.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02301302100016 H02301302200006</s>: In this verse there are four words for howling wild animals that inhabit deserted buildings: <i>tsiyim, ’ochim, ’iyim, tanim</i>. All except <i>tsiyim</i> probably mean “jackal"; however, to maintain the parallelism of the Hebrew poem, it is better to translate both <i>tsiyim</i> and <i>’iyim</i> as “hyenas". These verses will then be translated as:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Wailing hyenas will settle there,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Howling jackals will fill their houses.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Hyenas will wail in their fortresses,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>And jackals howl in their luxurious palaces.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>’ochim</i> occurs only here in the Bible. It is derived from a Hebrew word meaning “to howl". The <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> rendering “porcupines” is very questionable. “Owls” is a possibility, but “jackals” fits the context better, as it then preserves the parallelism of “jackals” and “hyenas".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Shu‘al</i>:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00701500400016</s>: Since jackals are easier to trap because they are more easily attracted to baits of meat, most modern translations interpret <i>shu‘al</i> as jackal in this passage.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01600400301000</s>: Since the fox is smaller and lighter than the jackal, fox is the preferred interpretation here. The meaning is thus something like “Even if a little fox were to climb on these walls they would collapse.” Where foxes or jackals are not known, an expression for a small dog could be used in this context.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01906301001000</s>: Since the reference is to the enemy soldiers dying in battle and becoming carrion (that is, lying unburied), the interpretation of <i>shu‘al</i> should be “jackals". <a>TEV</a> ’s “wolves” does not fit the context, since wolves are not noted as carrion eaters.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><s>02200201500006</s>: This verse is very difficult to interpret. While foxes may occasionally eat fallen grapes, or grapes low down on a vine, they cannot accurately be described as “ruiners of vineyards". It seems more likely that what is in focus is the fact that for Israelites jackals symbolize ruin (see note above on ). The verse would then mean something like: “Catch the jackals for us -(those little jackals that symbolize ruin for our vineyards. For our vineyards are thriving."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02500501800012 H02601300400004</s>: In these verses, where the context is one of ruin and desolation, “jackals” is the better interpretation.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Tan</i>:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01803002900008</s>: The interpretation should be “jackals are my brothers,” that is, both the jackals and I live in ruins.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01904401901000</s>: There are three possible interpretations for the first line of this text:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>a) Interpret <i>tanim</i> as “sea monster” and translate as do <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a>: “You crushed us as you did the sea serpent [or, sea monster]."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>b) Interpret “wailings” or “laments", as <a>NAB</a> does, and translate as “You crushed us in a place of misery” [literally, “in laments"].</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>c) Interpret <i>tanim</i> as “jackals", as <a>TEV</a> and <a>NIV</a> do, and translate as “You crushed us [disappointed us], and we became a place of jackals,” “you left us helpless among the jackals,” or “you crushed us and left us as ruins inhabited by jackals."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Interpretation c) reflects the later usage of the word.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In all other occurrences of <i>tan</i>, “jackal” fits the context best.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02405103401000</s>: Although many English versions translate <i>tan</i> in this verse as “dragon” or “serpent", it seems likely that “jackal” is better; jackals often swallow their food in a great hurry without chewing properly, and then vomit it later when they are under cover and eat it a second time more slowly.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>04201303200014</s>: In this verse, where <i>alōpēx</i> is used figuratively, it is more important to retain the inference associated with the word than to signify the exact animal. The word is slightly insulting, and the main exegetical decision to be made here is whether Jesus is using the term with the Greek connotation of “crafty opportunist” or with the Semitic connotation of “insignificant but self-important person.” Either would fit the context. If the former is in focus, Jesus is inferring that even though Herod Antipas is a crafty opportunist, his plans are known. If the latter sense is intended, as seems more likely, then Jesus is inferring that Herod does not have the power to stop him doing what he has to do. Some commentators have argued that both inferences are intended since both the Greek and Hebrew metaphors would have been known.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If the Greek inference is decided upon, then the word <i>alōpēx</i> could be translated “crafty fox” or “crafty jackal". If the Semitic inference is preferred, the word could be translated “insignificant jackal". In either case the word for a local animal that symbolizes crafty opportunism (for example, baboon) or self-important insignificance (for example, rabbit) can be used in the text, with a footnote to indicate that the original word means fox or jackal.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0587_leopard"/>Both leopards <i>Panthera pardus</i> and Cheetahs <i>Acinonyx jubatus</i> were fairly common in Israel until the twentieth century. Leopards lived both in the mountains and in the thick undergrowth found in many wadis and along the Jordan Valley. A very few still live in the Negev and in the wadis along the Dead Sea. Cheetahs lived in the semi-desert plains of Egypt the land of Israel Arabia and Syria. They were trained and used in hunting in both the Middle East and Egypt hundreds of years before Christ. They have now been hunted to extinction in these areas.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the Old Testament it is likely that the one Hebrew word <i>namer</i> and the Aramaic word <i>nemar</i> were used for both animals. The Greek word <i>pardalis</i> means leopard.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Leopards are the most widely distributed of all the great cats. They are found throughout tropical mainland Asia and Africa. They are about 2 meters (6 feet) in length and are a yellowish brown color with black spots arranged in rosettes all over the body and tail. These spots make it very easy for a leopard to blend in with patches of shade and sunlight in or under bushes and trees. They are extremely agile, and this agility and their natural camouflage are used to the full in their hunting methods. They stalk gazelles, antelope, or deer (occasionally goats or sheep) until they are within ten or fifteen meters (30-50 feet) or less. They then break cover and leap onto their prey. They have a slightly different strategy when hunting monkeys and baboons. They drive them to the extreme ends of branches by climbing after them, and when the monkey or baboon finally drops from the tree, the leopard leaps after it and catches it on the ground.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Once a leopard has killed an animal, it carries it into a tree or onto a high rock to eat, possibly to get away from hyenas. Once a leopard has satisfied its appetite, if there is still meat left on the carcass, it will leave the carcass in the fork of a branch and return to feed again later. The exception to this is when a female has cubs. She will then carry the kill to her cubs in a lair under rocks or a log, but she will still carry any leftover meat into a tree to store in the branches. Unlike lions and cheetahs, leopards do not chase their prey over long distances.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Leopards live and hunt alone, coming together only at mating time. Cubs stay with their mothers only until they can hunt on their own; they are usually completely on their own by the time they are one year old. A female leopard with cubs is very protective and extremely dangerous.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Occasionally a leopard will be born completely black (the so-called black panther). This is simply an ordinary leopard with a slight genetic abnormality known as melanism.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0124_cheetah"/>Cheetahs or hunting leopards as they are sometimes called are also spotted but are slightly smaller and have longer legs than leopards. They also have a vertical stripe across each eye. Unlike most other members of the cat family cheetahs cannot retract their claws. They are found throughout sub-Saharan Africa but their numbers are greatly reduced now. A few remain in South Asia where they were once plentiful.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Cheetahs live in small family groups and hunt together. They are extremely fast and rely on this speed in their hunting. They live in open grassland on plains and apart from the grass and low bushes there is often not much cover for them to use in stalking. They stalk their prey to within about fifty meters (55 yards) and then break cover and with a tremendous turn of speed chase the prey and attempt to catch it by the throat.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Leopards are often paired with lions in the biblical text and are thus a symbol of violent danger. In <s>03500100800008</s>, however, the <i>namer</i> is a symbol of speed. This would fit the cheetah rather than the leopard so the <a>NEB</a> rendering “hunting-leopards” is well justified.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In areas where both leopards and cheetahs are known, the word for cheetah is probably the best choice in <s>03500100800008</s>. Where leopards are not known, the word for jaguar, bobcat, puma, mountain lion, or tiger can be used. Elsewhere, a borrowed word or a transliteration will need to be used, taking the Hebrew or the dominant local language as the basis.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0596_lions"/>The word <i>’ari’el</i> in <s>01002302000052</s> and <s>01301102200048</s> literally means “lion of God” or “mighty lion", but it is an idiom denoting a human hero or mighty warrior, not a lion.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In some reference books, the Hebrew <i>gur</i> is also listed as a name for lion (cub). However, most scholars now believe that this word refers to the young of any carnivorous animal; it should only be taken as “lion cub” when one of the words for lion occurs as well, or when the context clearly indicates that a lion cub is meant, as for instance in cases of parallelism.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Among the English versions there seems to be a great deal of confusion and inconsistency in the translation of the various Hebrew words. This is due in large part to the fact that the English translators and the commentators who have guided them have had many mistaken ideas about lions and their behavior. To take <s>03000300400006</s> as an example, Smalley and de Waard, commenting on this verse and echoing Hughell Fosbroke and many others, claim: “The lion’s roar in the first picture is the ferocious roar with which the lion attacks an animal he is going to kill and eat. When someone hears this roar, he knows that the lion has found his victim. In the second picture, however, it is the lion’s contented growl when he has dragged the food to his den."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However, lions do not roar as they attack their prey, (in fact they kill very silently as a rule), and lions do not normally live in dens. Moreover, they do not growl contentedly when eating. Instead they growl and snarl at the other lions in the pride who are trying to share the meal.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In case there are readers who react by thinking that it is unlikely that unsophisticated ancient peoples would have known these details, it should be pointed out that unsophisticated people all over Africa, who live in areas where there are lions, are very familiar with lion behavior, and it is highly likely that the Jewish writers were too. The problem would seem to lie with the mistaken presuppositions of western biblical scholars, rather than those of the Jewish writers. Later in this section evidence will be given that the biblical writers were very familiar with lion behavior.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In a similar vein, it is likely that the many Hebrew words for lions each have a slightly different meaning from one another. A closer study of lions and their behavior may help to define these meanings.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In biblical times lions were found all over the Middle East, in Mesopotamia, in Egypt, and in the area of Sudan and Ethiopia called Cush.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek word <i>leōn</i> and the Latin <i>leo</i> are general words for lion, while the Greek <i>leontēdon</i> means something like “fierce lion".</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In order to dispel many of the wrong presuppositions about lions that are current among biblical scholars, the description of this animal will be more detailed and extensive than for other animals in this book.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Lions <i>Panthera leo</i> are the largest of the great cats, often being about 2.8 meters (9 feet) from nose to tip of tail, standing as high as 1 meter (3 feet 3 inches) at the shoulder. However, the difference in size between lions and Bengal Tigers <i>Panthera tigris</i> is minimal. An adult lion is at least half a meter (20 inches) longer than a Leopard <i>Panthera pardus</i> and weighs twice as much, often reaching 250 kilograms (550 pounds) in weight; it is about 30 centimeters (1 foot) longer and 100 kilograms (220 pounds) heavier than a Jaguar <i>Panthera onca</i> or Mountain Lion (Puma) <i>Puma concolor</i>. Lions are a pale yellowish brown, but at birth they have spots that usually disappear gradually as they grow. Around the neck and shoulders of adult males grows a mane that is darker than the rest of their fur. Some even have black manes. Females and young males do not have manes and look very similar to each other.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Social behavior</b>: Lions live in family groups called “prides", which are made up of a dominant male lion (often called “the pride male"), plus a group of adult and sub adult females and young males. Males may leave the pride, and occasionally one or two females may go off with a wandering male, but normally the females continue in the pride and develop very close bonds with one another that last a lifetime. The dominant male will often make ritual attacks on the younger males of the pride, who roll over in submission rather than fight.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However, adult males from within and outside the pride challenge the dominant male and one another when a female is in season and will try to mate with her. This results in serious fights. If the dominant male is defeated from within the pride, he leaves the pride to wander alone, but the remainder of the pride remains intact. If a male from outside the pride takes over from the pride male, he usually chases away the other males, which then wander singly or in small groups of three or four. These wandering males will try to take over other prides or steal females from them. Ousted pride males, since they are alone and have no help in hunting, are often hungry, thin, undernourished, and dangerous.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0595_lioness_cub"/>About two or three days before a pregnant female is about to give birth to cubs, she digs a temporary den under a rock or fallen log and visits it with one or two of the other females. After she gives birth in the den, one of the other females will bring her meat from a kill. This enables the mother to remain with her newborn cubs continuously for the first week or two of their lives. The mother lioness moves the newborn cubs to a new den every three or four days. When the cubs are about two weeks old, the mother carries the cubs to where the other pride members are, and the pride makes their acquaintance by licking them. Thereafter the cubs belong to the pride and suckle on any lactating lioness that happens to be near.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Until they are old enough to hunt, cubs hide in thickets while the pride hunters do their work. At a later stage they accompany the hunting lions, but watch the killing from the sidelines. Finally the mother will help them kill small animals, until they are able to kill efficiently. Then they join the pride hunts.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A pride lives together in the same territory. Bushes and tree trunks are marked by spraying a liquid from a gland next to the anus. This marked territory is defended against intruding lions. The pride will come together at feeding time and remain together after a feed, but will scatter across the territory prior to hunting.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Vocal behavior</b>: Lions utter a variety of sounds, and this should be borne in mind when translating Scripture passages that refer to the noises lions make. The Hebrew words are usually not very specific, but the context will indicate the type of noise intended.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Roaring is the loudest of the lion sounds and is usually produced by the males. It is believed to be territory-marking behavior and a means of maintaining pride solidarity. It is usually done before hunting begins and also functions to help the pride locate the positions of scattered members. This is important for hunting. Roaring consists of a long, very loud moaning sound followed by shorter rhythmic panting moans, which are repeated as many as twenty times, while becoming softer and softer. No two lions roar in exactly the same way, and they can be identified from their roars. Roaring is also a means by which wandering male lions make known their availability as potential mates. Hungry lions roar more frequently than well-fed ones, and this is an indication of how hungry they are.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Growling is a warning sound. It is a very deep rumbling repeated with each breath. It is intended to chase away strange lions or other potential enemies, such as leopards, hyenas, or humans. When a lion or lioness growls, it usually advances towards its enemy. If growling does not have the desired effect, it is replaced with snarling, which is similar to growling but is more intense and is produced with exposed teeth, the body in a low crouch, and ears laid back flat. This behavior is usually the prelude to an attack. When the attack is actually made on an enemy, a deep trembling moan is uttered, and the ensuing fight takes place with a lot of loud snarling and growling.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>When lions are feeding together on one carcass, there is usually a lot of growling, snarling, and snapping among the feeding lions.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Other types of sound made by lions are:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>woofing sounds when pride members meet after two or three days’ absence from each other. This sound is also used to call cubs from their hiding places;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>- drawn out yawning moans by females in heat and by both lions and lionesses when mating;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>- grunting sounds when chasing prey toward other lions waiting in ambush;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>- contented loud purring, much as cats do.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Hunting and feeding behavior</b>: After lions have fed well, they rest and relax together for two or three days. Towards the end of this time some of the pride members will begin to move away from the others in the direction of places where prey animals are likely to be grazing. Then, before they begin to hunt, they signal their locations by roaring on and off for an hour or two. They then fall silent and begin to hunt in earnest. Hunting usually takes one of two forms. If there is good cover near the prey, two or three lionesses and young males will stalk the prey using the cover. When they get close enough, one or two will break cover and charge at the prey, while the others maneuver to cut off any escape.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0593_lion"/>If the terrain is more open, the lionesses and young males will take up ambush positions downwind of the prey animals. Adult males then move fairly openly into upwind positions. They then run toward the prey uttering loud grunts with each breath. With either method, at the first charge the lions try to disable the animal by seizing a leg or by biting the spine. Once they have slowed down the prey, one lion will seize the animal by the throat and suffocate it. Thus death is usually fairly slow and drawn out. If the animal is large, the kill takes a considerable amount of energy, and the lions rest, usually standing, before they begin to feed.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Single wandering male lions are at a great disadvantage in hunting and often go hungry. They thus roar more frequently than pride lions. They often begin to kill domestic animals and sometimes humans.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Among the lions present at the time of the kill, there is a type of seniority, with age being important. The most senior lion or lioness present will begin to feed, and this will be a signal for the others to join in. If the kill is large, they feed in relative silence, but if the prey is small, there is a lot of snarling, growling, and snapping. Whenever a dominant pride male arrives, however, the feeding lions withdraw and leave him to feed alone. A dominant male will sometimes allow an immature cub to feed with him but no mature lions. The pride members will only resume feeding when the dominant male is satisfied. Dominant males are very seldom involved in the chase or the kill. At most they make the charge that drives the prey towards lionesses and young males in ambush.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Before discussing specific passages in detail, it is useful first to try and identify the various Hebrew words with likely lion types.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If we examine the verbs and adjectives with which the Hebrew nouns co-occur, we find the following:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>’Ari</i>: This, the most frequently used word for lion, is associated with a very wide range of verbs in the Bible, including crouching in ambush, leaping, growling, roaring, killing, destroying, tearing prey to pieces, breaking bones, attacking, breaking from cover, scattering sheep, trampling, and standing on prey. The adjectives used with this noun include strong, destructive, brave, and hungry.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>From this evidence we can see that <i>’ari</i> or its feminine form <i>’aryeh</i> is the general word for lion or lioness.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>’Aryeh</i>: Although this is a feminine form, in English versions it is invariably translated as “lion", because this form usually occurs in the Hebrew phrase <i>gur ’aryeh</i>, which is literally “a cub of lioness", but which is more naturally translated as “lion cub” in English.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Beney shachats</i>: This expression, which literally means “sons of pride", occurs only once, in a poetic passage (<s>01802800800008</s>) as the parallel of “lion” (<i>shachal</i>). Probably, besides having similar sounds, the two expressions both refer to lions. Only <a>KJV</a> reflects this in the translation.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Kefir</i>: The verbs associated with this noun include kill, prowl, hunt, snarl, attack, break cover, tear prey to pieces, roar, and growl. The only adjective associated with the noun is “angry". Translators often render this as “young lion". <s>02601900101000-02601900901000</s> seems to support an identification of <i>kefir</i> with a young male lion that is an efficient killer (see the discussion of this passage below).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Laviy’</i>: The verbs associated with this noun are growling, devouring, lying down, crouching, and raising cubs. The only descriptive phrase that co-occurs is big teeth. The usual <a>JB</a> rendering of this word as “lioness” seems well founded.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Layish</i>: This noun occurs only three times. The verb phrase that co-occurs is “ dying from lack of prey". The adjectives that co-occur are “stately in its walk", and “strong". The evidence would fit an interpretation such as “lion in its prime time” or “mighty lion". The reference would seem to be to a dominant male lion or “pride male". Versions that render this word as “old lion” in some contexts (<a>RSV</a>, <a>JB</a>, <a>NAB</a>), seem to be slightly misleading.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Shachal</i>: The verbs that co-occur are roaring, hunting, and tearing prey to pieces. Some scholars, using evidence from Assyrian and classical Arabic, believe that this Hebrew word is derived from an older Semitic root meaning “to roar” or “to produce a call". All available evidence would seem to allow for the interpretation of <i>shachal</i> as “male lion". It may possibly be a word for a wandering male lion rather than a male that is a member of a pride.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In some English versions of Maccabees the Greek word <i>skumnos</i> is incorrectly translated as “cub” or “whelp". The context refers to this creature roaring, which lion cubs do not do. The word seems rather to refer to a virile young adult lion. It is better translated as lion in its prime compare <a>TEV</a> “like a ferocious lion."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In areas where lions are completely unknown, it is better to borrow a word from a dominant language or from Hebrew or Greek, rather than to try and find a local equivalent. This is because the biblical references to the behavior of lions are fairly specific, and if a word for a local animal is used, it will not fit the behavior mentioned in the text. This is especially so because the lion is the only great cat (apart from the cheetah) that lives and hunts in large family groups.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Some attempt should be made to maintain the slight differences in meaning of the various Hebrew words for lions, when the context requires this. This can often be done by using short, natural-sounding descriptive phrases. Often, however, in contexts where only one of the Hebrew words for lion is used, there is no need to maintain a difference, and a simple word for lion or lioness will suffice.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The most common Hebrew phrases used for the sounds lions make are <i>sha’ag</i>, <i>(natan) qol</i>, <i>naham</i>. When <i>sha’ag</i> is used in contexts of human vocal behavior, it indicates cries of pain or distress. In contexts of animal vocal behavior, however, it can signal pain and distress but can also be an aggressive sound and can be translated “bellow, roar, moan, snarl, growl” or sometimes “bark". A similar Arabic word usually refers to the lowing of cattle or the bleating of goats. For lions English translators have consistently chosen “roar", because of their mistaken preconception that a lion’s “roar” is an aggressive sound. In most contexts it is best interpreted as “growl” or “snarl".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>(<i>Natan</i>) <i>qol</i>, on the other hand, is a more general expression and can mean any sort of vocalization, from calling, to groaning or singing. English translators of <s>03000300400006</s> have chosen “growl” (<a>TEV</a>, <a>REB</a>, <a>NIV</a>) and “cry out” (<a>RSV</a>). In this text this word is the parallel of <i>sha’ag</i>, so the reason for these interpretations is plain. However, a neutral translation, such as “make a sound", would be equally valid. Of all the Hebrew expressions for lion sounds, this is the one most likely to mean roar, especially in contexts where the noun <i>shachal</i> occurs for “lion", as for example in <s>01800401000010</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Naham</i> means to moan in sorrow or pain when used of humans and is usually translated as to growl when used of animals.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Lion habitats and the meaning of <i>ma‘on</i> in the context of lions</b>: Generally the word <i>ma‘on</i> means dwelling place, hiding place, or refuge. In one or two places it refers to a military refuge or fortress. When used of animals, it can mean “lair” (as for jackals), “hiding place", “territory", or simply “place where the animals are found". The choice in translating this Hebrew word has been either “lair” or “den” in all English translations. This choice again seems to be related to the misconceptions about the behavior of lions. Lions do not usually live in dens or lairs, and it is better to translate <i>ma‘on</i> as “territory” or “place where lions live". See the discussion below for <s>03000300400032</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00104900801000 H00104901001000</s>: The major problems in interpreting this passage relate to the meaning of the verb <i>‘alah</i>. TEV, REB, and NIV interpret <s>‘alah</s> in verse 9 as “return” (<a>TEV</a> even has “return to his den"). However, the more usual meaning of the Hebrew verb is “to rise up", and in this context this makes perfect sense. As mentioned above, when a lion has killed its prey, the lion usually stands up, panting, and rests in this position for some minutes before crouching down again to start feeding.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01800401001000 H01800401101000</s>: In this passage there is clearly a logical link between the fact that the teeth of the efficient killers (<i>kefirim</i>) are broken and the fact that the dominant male (<i>layish</i>) is dying because no kills have been made. Most English translations translate <i>taref</i> as “prey", which infers that the problem is a lack of animals to hunt. It would be better to translate this word as “kills", that is, animals that have been killed.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01902201301000</s>: The Hebrew of this passage indicates clearly that the growling or snarling and the tearing at prey are directed at the writer.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02405103801000 H02405103901000</s>: The English translations that take <i>kefir</i> to mean “young lions” misrepresent slightly the picture portrayed in this verse. Rather than being the immature roar of young lions, the text refers to the frightening roar of hungry hunting lions.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02601900101000 H02601900901000</s>: In this passage the picture of a lioness training her cubs to become efficient killers is clearly presented. This gives us a good indication of the meaning of <i>kefir</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02801101001000</s>: The picture here is of a lion roaring and the other members of the pride coming in response. The picture given in <a>TEV</a> of God roaring at his enemies is not justified.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>03000300401000</s>: A choice has to be made about the type of vocalizing the lion is doing, and why. If, as the existing text seems to require, the presupposition is that the lion has caught its prey, then the translation of <i>sha’ag</i> and <i>natan qol</i> will involve appropriate choices. “Snarl” and “growl” seem to be legitimate. These fit the context, match real lion behavior, and are still valid translations of the Hebrew roots.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Next, it is necessary to make a suitable choice for <i>ma‘on</i>. “The place where it hides” would be quite appropriate, paralleling “bush” in the first line of the couplet.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The two words for lion in this verse are <i>’aryeh</i> and <i>kefir</i>. The first should be rendered “lioness” and the second “lion” or “killer lion".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>A Translator’s Handbook on the Book of Amos</i> can thus be rephrased: “The snarling in the first line and the growling in the second both refer to the warning sounds lions make when feeding together."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Figure 13 in the Amos Handbook gives an analysis in which the relationship of this verse to the argument is seen as being the theme “Disaster", presumably that which has befallen the prey. However, if the lion is consistently seen as the symbol of God, then one would expect <s>03000300401000</s> to be seen as inferring that God is “roaring” (to use the Handbook’s interpretation) because a disaster has already befallen the nation of Israel, just as a “lion roars because it has caught its prey". Yet in the corresponding element of the chiasmus, <s>03000300801000</s> a, the analysis in the Handbook identifies the disaster as being in the future, since the “roar” is interpreted as a warning. The analysis is thus not cohesive at these points.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If, however, the growling and snarling (rather than roaring) refer to the aggressive behavior of feeding lions toward each other and toward other predators and scavengers, their behavior would be more closely related to warning than to destroying. This shows better cohesion between <s>03000300401000</s> and <s>03000300801000</s> a. If <i>sha’ag</i> in <s>03000300800004</s> a is also translated “snarl", the warning effect is greatly heightened.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The labels on the Handbook’s chiastic structure would now be:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A Harmony</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>B Warning signs</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>C Disaster</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>D Confusion</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>C' Disaster</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>B' Warning signs</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A' Harmony</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Interestingly enough this alternate translation does not change the basic arguments as identified by the Handbook, but strengthens them.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>03300201101000 H03300201201000</s>: The major problems of interpretation in this verse, have been the word <i>kefir</i>, usually translated here as “cubs", and the words <i>ma‘on</i>, <i>mir‘eh</i>, and <i>chor</i>, usually translated as “den", “lair", and “cave".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In RSV, NEB, and REB, the presupposition is that lions live in dens, to which they carry their prey, and that the male lion in the passage tears up a carcass to feed to the lionesses and cubs. <a>TEV</a> shares this presupposition but adds the idea that lion cubs are fed in the den. But, as we have seen, lions do not live in dens, and male lions do not tear up carcasses to feed cubs. And they certainly do not feed lionesses; they usually compete with them for the meat.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A better interpretation is to take <i>kefir</i> in the same way as in the previous passages, that is, as killer lion. <i>Ma‘on</i> seems to mean “dwelling place, territory” in this context. <i>Mir‘eh</i> is interpreted in <a>NIV</a> and <a>TEV</a> as “feeding place", which fits the context well. This leaves <i>chor</i>, which functions here as a parallel expression to <i>me‘onot</i> “territories". <i>Chor</i> normally means “hole” or “cave” and can be taken to refer to the temporary dens where suckling lionesses are fed by other lionesses.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0637_molerat"/>This word occurs only once in the Hebrew Bible and it is very difficult to know what it refers to. In the Masoretic Text it is written as two words <i>lachpor perot</i> which seem to mean “to dig holes". But the ancient versions interpret the two words of the Masoretic Text to be a single word <i>lachafarparot</i> a noun phrase literally meaning to “the dig-diggers” or “to the search-searchers” so it is taken by them to mean “to the moles". The verb form <i>chafar</i> occurs more frequently in the Bible and means “to dig", “to search” or “to spy” (<s>00600200201000 H00600200301000</s>). The only place where the supposed noun form occurs is in <s>02300202000046</s> where it is in parallel with a word meaning “bats". “Moles” and “bats” seems to be a strange pairing especially since the Israelites classified bats among the birds.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Besides “moles” other interpretations that have been made by commentators are “scavengers” (which both search and dig around in refuse) “woodborers” (a type of small beetle) and “woodpeckers".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Strictly speaking moles which feed on worms are not found in Israel. The closest equivalent there is the Syrian Mole Rat <i>Spalax leucodon ehrenbergi</i> which burrows underground like a mole but is a rodent feeding on roots and bulbs.</Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>Some scholars and some versions translate the Hebrew word <i>choled</i> as “mole rat” or “mole", but see <l target="FAUNA:2.26">2.26 Mongoose, weasel</l>. <a>KJV</a> translates another Hebrew word <i>tinshemeth</i> as “mole", but see <l target="FAUNA:4.3">4.3 Chameleon</l>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0733_prairie_dogs"/>Syrian mole rats are gray rodents that grow to about twenty centimeters (8 inches) in length with very large teeth that protrude from the front of the mouth. They live almost entirely underground, digging their tunnels just below the ground surface with their large teeth and flat front paws. From time to time they eject surplus soil onto the surface of the ground, making small heaps, and thereby giving away their presence. They are blind, and live on roots.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Any translation of this word is guesswork. The translator is probably safest in following one of the well-known English versions, even though they too are based on conjecture. In an attempt to make better sense in the context, any of the alternative suggestions made above may be followed, but a footnote should indicate that the meaning of the Hebrew word is uncertain.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If the interpretation mole rat is accepted, similar animals are found all over sandy parts of Africa, (belonging to the animal family known scientifically as <i>Bathyergomorpha</i>), and a name for one of the local varieties can easily be used. The Cane Rat <i>Thryonomys swinderianus</i> (known as the grass-cutter in West Africa) is another possibility. In North America either the Pocket Gopher <i>Geomys bursarius</i> or the Prairie Dog <i>Cynomys ludovicianus</i> is probably the best local choice, while in India and Southeast Asia the Bamboo Rat <i>Rhizomys</i> is a local possibility. In South America one may use the local name for one of the Tuco-tucos <i>Ctenomys</i>, Hutias <i>Geocapromys</i>, Viscachas <i>Lagostomus maximus</i>, or Guinea Pigs <i>Cavia porcellus</i>. Elsewhere it is possible to use a word for similar moles or rat-like animals that burrow.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0638_mongoose"/>There is considerable disagreement about the meaning of the word <i>choled</i>. The root of the word may be a form related to a verb meaning “to dig". Those who accept this translate <i>choled</i> as either “mole” (which is not indigenous to the land of Israel) “mole rat” or “rat". However there is another more likely Semitic root for the word which means “to creep", or “wriggle". Those who accept this latter derivation translate <i>choled</i> as “weasel".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The true Weasel <i>Mustela nivalis</i> was found in Israel and Jordan perhaps as late as the nineteenth century. However a much more common animal is the weasel-like Egyptian Mongoose <i>Herpestes ichneumon</i> an animal that was sacred to the ancient Egyptians and associated with the moon goddess. Another weasel-like animal reported in Israel is the Marbled Polecat <i>Vormela peregusna</i>. Any of these three animals could be the <i>choled</i> of the Bible. A majority of zoologists support the mongoose its association with Egyptian religion would also make it a likely candidate.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><b>Weasels</b> are small carnivorous animals with long bodies and short legs, a little larger than a big rat. They eat mice, small birds, frogs, and birds’ eggs. They are reddish brown with white underparts. They move very fast and are constantly moving. They seem to glide over the ground. They are small enough to fit into large mouse holes. They are active in the day and the night.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><u>The Egyptian mongoose</u> is larger than the weasel about eighty centimeters (2.5 feet) from nose to tail tip. It also has a long body and short legs. It is gray all over with a black tip to its tail. It lives in reed beds and thick undergrowth and eats mice, rats, lizards, snakes, chickens, birds, insects and eggs, hunting both day and night.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0725_polecat"/>The <b>marbled polecat</b> is fairly common in Israel today. It is smaller than the Egyptian mongoose but bigger than the weasel. The lower half of its head and body is black with a white patch on its chest. Its back has patches of brown on a yellowish brown background. Its diet is similar to that of the Egyptian mongoose but it hunts only at night. When threatened it squirts at its enemy a very obnoxious fluid from a gland near its anus. This fluid has a very bad smell that is difficult to get rid of.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In Asia one of the Asiatic mongooses or civets is the closest equivalent. In North and Central America one of the local weasels or skunks, and in Africa one of the larger mongooses or polecats are the obvious choices. In Australasia the Native Cat <i>Dasyurus quoll</i> or <i>Dasyurops maculatus</i>, or the Tasmanian Devil <i>Sarcophilus harrisii</i> would be reasonable equivalents. Elsewhere, a term like “rat-eater” or a transliteration will have to be used.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0656_mouse"/>The Hebrew word <i>‘akbar</i> is a very general one including all of the small rodents. The word thus includes house mice, field mice, voles, dormice, jerboas, jirds, gerbils (sand or desert rats), black rats, brown rats, hamsters, and others. The Canaanites hunted and ate the larger rodents such as jerboas and gerbils (which are not rats at all, in spite of their nickname “sand rats"), and so do many of the desert tribes today in the Middle East.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>It would not be possible to describe here all the various rodents covered by the Hebrew word <i>‘akbar</i>. The descriptions will thus be limited to rats, voles, jerboas, and gerbils. House mice and field mice are too well known all over the world to warrant description.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0749_rat"/><b>Rats</b> are larger than mice (25-30 centimeters [1 foot] long including tail) but otherwise look very much like them. Both the Black Rat <i>Rattus rattus</i> and the Brown Rat <i>Rattus norvegicus</i> vary in color from black to grayish brown with the brown rat having a slightly shorter snout. The black rat is host to a certain type of flea that is a carrier of the dreaded bubonic plague. Although zoologists in the 1960’s believed that <i>Rattus rattus</i> originated in Asia remains of this rat have been found in Israel dating from prehistoric times. The Brown Norwegian Rat only arrived in the land in the 1930’s.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0892_vole"/><b>Levant Vole</b><i>Microtus socialis guentheri</i>: Voles differ from small mice only in the shape of their cheek teeth so to most people they look just like mice. They are small grayish brown and have pale bellies. They feed on grass stalks and the stalks of grains such as wheat and barley. They are active day and night for about two or three hours at a time eating their own body weight and more each day. They also produce up to sixteen litters a year with up to twelve babies in a litter. Thus in a good season when there is plenty of food and cover in which to hide from predators their population explodes and this vast increase in numbers poses a very serious threat to crops. Of all mice these are the most destructive.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0545_jerboa"/><b>Lesser Jerboa</b><i>Jaculus jaculus</i>: The scientific name means “jumper". Jerboas are slightly larger than most mice and have very long hind legs and very short front legs. They hop like kangaroos and are even known (erroneously) as “kangaroo rats". They have a long tail with a tuft at the end and this is used for balance when they hop. They live in desert and semidesert areas and are the color of sand. They are active only at night and have large eyes and ears to compensate for this. They feed on seeds and can go without water for long periods.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0262_gerbil"/><b>Palestinian Gerbil</b><i>Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi</i>: Gerbils are very similar to jerboas but are smaller. When alarmed they can move very fast covering up to 3 meters (10 feet) with each leap. Although called “sand rats” or “desert rats", they are actually not rats at all in the strict sense of the word.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In <s>00301102900036</s> the <i>‘akbar</i> is listed as an unclean animal. It is not clear and has often been debated by rabbinic scholars whether all “mice” are included in the ban, or only some species. Jerboas, gerbils, and hamsters are a common food among Middle Eastern desert tribes and are not classified as “mice” today.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>: The major exegetical choice to be made by the translator is whether the ban is on all types of small rodents or only on some. Commentators are divided on the issue. <a>NEB</a>, <a>JB</a>, <a>NIV</a>, and <a>REB</a> all take the prohibition to apply to specific species: rats (<a>JB</a> and <a>NIV</a>) or jerboas (<a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a>). “Rats” is an understandable choice, since rats, especially the black rat, are known to be carriers of disease. <a>TEV</a> takes the view that all species are included in the ban and has “rats, mice". <a>KJV</a>, <a>RSV</a>, and <a>NAB</a> have “mouse", probably with a wide rather than a restricted meaning.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00900500601000</s>: There is a textual problem in this verse. In the Masoretic Text there is only one plague mentioned, namely “tumors". <a>KJV</a>, <a>RSV</a>, <a>JB</a>, <a>NIV</a>, and <a>TEV</a> follow this reading. In the Septuagint and the Vulgate two plagues are mentioned, “tumors", and “rats/mice". Some scholars accept this as the better reading, since the difference can be explained as a line of the Hebrew text omitted by a scribe when making a copy. (This is quite a common error.) This is the reading accepted by <a>NEB</a>, <a>REB</a>, and <a>NAB</a>. This reading also explains why two plagues are referred to in the next chapter. Even if only one plague remains in the text, it is interpreted by the majority of commentaries as bubonic plague, which is associated with the black rat.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If the Septuagint reading is accepted, two possible interpretations exist. If the two plagues are taken as being associated closely, that is, that the tumors were linked to the rats and the plague was bubonic plague, then the translation rats is the proper one here and in <s>00900600000000</s>. (In <a>TEV</a> the plague in chapter 6 is identified as bubonic plague in a footnote, but <i>‘akbarim</i> is surprisingly translated as “mice"!) If, however, the “mice” are not taken as associated with the tumors, then it is possible that the second plague was a sudden increase in the population of destructive voles.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02306601700048</s>: The same word should be used in this verse as in <s>00301102900036</s>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The word <i>pirdah</i> refers to the female mule while <i>pered</i> can refer to either the male or the female. In biblical times mules were used for riding and as pack animals while horses were mainly used to pull military chariots. They appear to have been introduced into Canaan much later than horses. Mules are not mentioned in the Bible until the time of David while horses are mentioned in the Joseph story and in <s>00501701601000</s> where the king is forbidden to acquire them. Technically the owning of mules was not prohibited although the breeding of them would have fallen under the prohibition of <s>00301901901000</s>, which forbade the cross-breeding of animals. The Israelites thus seem to have relied on mules imported from neighboring countries.</Paragraph>

It is also possible to breed male horses with female donkeys, but the offspring, technically called “hinnies", not “mules", are usually smaller than mules. Mules are bigger and stronger than donkeys and are much more resistant to disease than either horses or donkeys. They are usually dark brown with bigger ears than the parent horse.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Although there are male and female mules they are infertile and not able to breed. This makes the stronger males much easier to handle than stallions.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0689_oryx"/>The Arabian or Desert Oryx <i>Oryx leucoryx</i> is a medium-sized antelope, about the size of a donkey. It is closely related to the African oryxes, such as the Gemsbok <i>Oryx gazella</i> of the Kalahari and Namib semideserts, the East African Oryx <i>Oryx beisa</i>, and the Scimitar-horned Oryx <i>Oryx algazel</i> of the Sudan and Egypt. In many ways the oryx is also similar to, but smaller than, the Sable Antelope <i>Hippotragus niger</i> and the Roan Antelope <i>Hippotragus equinus</i>, both of which are found in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Angola.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Arabian oryx, which was once plentiful in the land of Israel is now almost extinct and the only remaining specimens have been bred in semicaptivity and in captivity from one small breeding herd. This inbreeding and captivity have resulted in marked genetic deterioration so that today’s specimens are smaller and weaker than their ancestors and many have deformed horns. So although the specimens in photographs give us a rough idea of what the original Arabian oryx was like, these modern defects should be borne in mind.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Both males and females of the Arabian oryx have long slender horns that are usually over a meter (3 feet) long. The horns are almost straight and slope back from the animal’s head at about thirty degrees from the perpendicular. The adults are a light fawn color with dark brown markings on the face and on the lower part of both front and back legs. The belly is white.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the wild oryxes are well able to defend themselves with their long horns and the African species are often able to drive off lions and other predators sometimes even killing their attackers. When wounded by hunters they are extremely dangerous. They are also very strong runners. They live in semi-desert conditions and are very hardy.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The oryx was known for its strength (perhaps exaggerated since strength was associated with long horns) and bravery. Oryx horns are the longest horns known in the Middle East and North Africa and since horns were a symbol of power and strength this probably added to the association of the oryx with power. According to some Jewish scholars oryx horns were later used to make special <i>shofar</i> trumpets blown only at Passover. The oryx is listed among the clean animals.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In Africa and other areas where oryxes or sable and roan antelopes are known, the word for one of these animals could be used throughout. Elsewhere, a term, such as “long-horned antelopes", could be used for <i>te’o</i>, or a transliteration of the Hebrew word might be considered, with a description given in a footnote or in the glossary.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0713_pigs"/>The word <i>chazir</i> is used for domestic and wild pigs. The domesticated pig was known in Egypt around 2500 B.C. and was probably domesticated in Canaan about that time too. Domestication of wild pigs seems to have coincided everywhere with the development of agriculture. Wild pigs were probably penned in large enclosures and fed scraps, thus keeping them away from planted fields. Later on, when full domestication had taken place, it was more usual for pigs to be herded rather than kept in pens. Pigs eat almost anything and herding did away with the necessity to feed them. It soon was noticed that the rooting activity of the pigs rid areas of tree roots and shrubs and promoted the growth of grass for grazing. So early swineherds herded the pigs into areas where future grazing was wanted, away from planted fields. Jews who kept pigs may not have done so with the idea of eating their meat, which was unclean, but to promote grazing grass and to sell the pigs to neighboring tribes.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Wild pigs, in the form of the European Boar <i>Sus scrofus</i>, were once abundant in Israel, especially in the Jordan Valley. Even now since neither Jews nor Moslems eat the meat of wild pigs, and thus do not hunt them, they can still be found in the Jordan Valley and in many other areas where there is both water and thick undergrowth.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek words <i>choiros</i> and <i>hueios</i> mean “pig” or “pig meat". The word <i>hus</i> means a female pig or sow.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In languages that differentiate between wild and domestic pigs, in <s>01908001301000</s> the word for a wild pig should be used. In <s>06100202200028</s>, although the Greek specifies a female pig, the gender of the pig is not really important in the proverb. Many translations have simply “pig".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew expression “wild animals of the reeds” in <s>01906803001000</s> is probably a reference to wild pigs and may be translated “wild pigs in the reeds".</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Before the time of Abraham at least five breeds of sheep had already been developed in Mesopotamia. From mummified remains (that is, preserved dead bodies) and ancient art it is also known that at least two different breeds had reached Egypt by about 2000 B.C. Thus it is likely that the sheep mentioned in the Bible were of more than one breed.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>kar</i> seems to be used of imported foreign sheep and may refer to a special breed but some scholars think it refers to a wether (castrated ram), since this word is never used in the context of sacrifice. This word is also used for a battering ram, that is, a heavy pole suspended on a rope, used in war for breaking down walls. <i>’Ayil</i> is the word for a ram or adult male sheep, <i>rachel</i> is a breeding ewe or female sheep, and <i>taleh</i> is a very young lamb, probably still unweaned. The remaining Hebrew words refer to sheep in general.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek word <i>probaton</i> is the general word for sheep, or flocks that may include goats. <i>Krios</i> is the Greek word for a ram or male sheep. <i>Pascha</i> is a technical name for the Passover lamb exclusively, and the remaining Greek words all mean lamb. <i>Ovis</i> is the Latin word for sheep.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The early Hebrews were nomadic shepherds to whom sheep were the most important domestic animal. While goats eat almost any vegetation, sheep are much more selective about the grasses and plants they eat. This meant that suitable grazing for them was not always easy to find, and shepherds had to keep moving their flocks from place to place. This led to a nomadic lifestyle, with movable tents rather than houses being the normal household shelter. It was not until the occupation of Canaan after the Exodus that the lifestyle of the Israelites changed, and they became settled village-dwelling farmers and fruit growers.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However, even then, most households owned sheep, and some family members would function as shepherds, often living away from home for fairly long periods.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Sheep in the Bible were a source of meat, milk, wool, hides, and horns, and it seems likely that various strains were bred selectively to enhance production of these commodities. Wool is mentioned in the Bible as early as the Mosaic Law, which forbade the weaving of cloth containing both wool and plant fibers. The shearing of sheep is mentioned even earlier, in <s>00103101901000</s>. Wool was in fact the most common and available fiber known to the people of Israel.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There was a very extensive wool trade in biblical times, stretching from Egypt to China. In the Middle East wool was cheaper than cotton or linen, which were the other common fibers. (Silk was known by the time of Solomon, but it was extremely expensive as it was produced in China and handled by numerous traders on its way west.) It would be a mistake to think of all wool at that time as being white, as <s>00103000000000</s> indicates quite clearly that there were also dark colored sheep and sheep that had dark and light patches, probably varying combinations of black, white, and brown.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0119_ewe_with_lamb"/>We can be fairly sure that one breed of sheep known to the Israelites was the Fat-tailed Sheep <i>Ovis laticaudata</i> and that its fatty tail is referred to in <s>00202902200010 H00300300901000 H00300802501000 H00300901900022</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Rams’ horns had a variety of uses. Whole ram horns were used as drinking vessels, jars, and trumpets. But pieces of horn were used as handles for knives and other household implements, and for jewelry such as bracelets and beads. Needles too, and probably also arrow heads, were made from horn, as well as from bone and later from bronze and iron.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Sheep were also very important in Israelite religion. They were a very important element in the sacrificial system and in the traditional religious feasts, especially the Feast of Passover.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Sheep and goats belong to the same general family. They differ in that sheep produce wool, which is a special type of soft hair, among the ordinary hairs on their bodies. A ram’s horns too differ in shape from a goat’s horns, those of a ram curling down in a tight spiral beside its face, with those of a goat curving more gently back towards its shoulders. The sheep of biblical times produced much shorter wool than is common with wool-bearing breeds of today.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The fat-tailed or broad-tailed sheep is a smallish breed usually brown and white with a very broad tail. Like most other breeds of sheep in the Middle East it has large floppy ears.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Sheep are generally fairly timid animals, lacking the self-confidence and adaptability of goats. While goats will spread out in their search for food and then regroup without much difficulty, sheep become very insecure when they are separated from other sheep and tend to stay bunched together. They thus require a lot of shepherding. In the Middle East the method of shepherding involves training the dominant ram to follow the shepherd. The remaining sheep then follow this dominant ram, which often wears a wooden clapper or a bell. As they feed, the sheep usually keep within earshot of this sound. It is likely that this method is centuries old. (For further comparison of sheep and goats, see <l target="FAUNA:2.16">2.16 Goat</l>.)</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0806_shepherd"/>In most modern breeds only male sheep have horns, but in most ancient breeds female sheep had short horns too. This made separating sheep from goats in a single flock more difficult than it is today. See also the illustration in <l target="FAUNA:2.31.1">2.31.1 Flock, herd</l>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Of all animals the sheep was the most important for the Israelite nation. It had great religious, social, and economic importance.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the Bible sheep are a common metaphor for the people of Israel and perhaps for people in general. Like sheep the people are seen as easily going astray (<s>01911917601000 H02305300601000 H02405000601000 G06000202500008</s>), as being in need of guidance and protection (<s>01102201701000 H01401801601000 G04000903600028 G04100603400026</s>), as being very defenseless (<s>02305200701000</s>), and as being destined to an early death (<s>01904402201000 H02401200301000 G04500803600024</s>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0092_lamb"/>The metaphor of a lamb is used in the New Testament to refer to Christ, with an emphasis on his being a sacrifice for the sin of the world. This is especially the case in John’s gospel and Revelation. In the latter book the metaphor is introduced in a very striking way. In <s>06600500501000</s> as the writer is mourning the fact that no one can be found to open the scroll, he is comforted by one of the elders who tells him that “the Lion of the tribe of Judah” has triumphed and can thus open the scroll. Then the writer, expecting to see the Lion, sees instead a Lamb that looks as if it has been killed for sacrifice. The remainder of the book is then concerned with describing the triumph of this Lamb over the forces of evil.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the gospels Jesus also refers to his disciples as “sheep” and “lambs” (<s>04001001701000 G04301000100030 G04302101500058 G04302101700074 G04302101801000</s>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The metaphor of the shepherd is extended to God himself who is the ultimate “Shepherd of Israel” (<s>01902300101000 H01908000101000</s>). Then those who are responsible for the nurture, guidance, ruling, and protection of Israel, be it kings, prophets, or priests, are also likened to shepherds (<s>02305601101000 H02402300401000 H02404901901000 H02603400201000 H03801000201000</s>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Messiah is also called a shepherd (<s>02304001100016</s>), and Jesus refers to himself as “the good shepherd” (<s>04301001100034</s>). In <s>05801302000026</s> he is referred to as “the great shepherd of the sheep” and in <s>06000202500008</s> he is called “the Shepherd and Guardian of your lives".</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In languages that have a word for sheep, it is advisable to translate according to the meanings given under <u>Discussion</u> above. If possible, the feminine forms should be translated as “female lamb” or “female sheep". In languages in which sheep are not known, a word has usually been coined or borrowed by the time Bible translation begins, and this word should be used. It is not advisable to substitute another locally well-known animal in this case, since doing so negates the ritual and symbolic importance that sheep had for the biblical cultures.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In translating <s>01902300101000</s> it is extremely important to make sure that the phrase “my shepherd” preserves the relationship intended by the writer and reflects the psalmist’s theme that Yahweh is his benefactor, protector, and guide. There are really two metaphors involved in the opening verse-the caring shepherd (God) and by clear implication, the dependent sheep (the psalmist). In many languages the literal phrase “my shepherd” depicts a wrong relationship, meaning something like “the one who looks after my sheep” or “the one I employ to watch my sheep.” In many African languages unwary translators have produced a rendering that means “The Chief is (nothing more than) my herdsman.” It is often necessary to restructure the whole verse as something like “I am a sheep, and the lord is my shepherd."</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0805_sheep_flock"/>To people in Bible times sheep were the basic domestic animals. A poor person may not have owned any cattle or goats but would generally have had sheep. In Nathan’s parable in <s>01001200301000-01001200601000</s> the poverty of the one person is emphasized by the fact that he had only one lamb.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A wealthy person, on the other hand might own so many animals of different kinds that the herd would be divided up into flocks, each of which had its own herding personnel. In the search for grazing and water, the different flocks, all belonging to one person, would be scattered in different areas. In biblical Hebrew a combination of flocks of domestic animals can be referred to by the inclusive word <i>‘eder</i>. This word usually includes sheep, but it can also include goats, cattle, donkeys, and possibly even camels. Within a person’s <i>‘eder</i> sheep would have been the most numerous. If a writer wanted to be more specific, the groups of domestic animals within the <i>‘eder</i> could be referred to with words meaning flocks, cattle, donkeys, and camels.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This “flock” within an <i>‘eder</i> was called in Hebrew <i>ts’on</i>. This word always included sheep but could include goats too. Within the <i>ts’on</i> sheep would outnumber goats.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A <i>ts’on</i> consisted of individual animals called <i>seh</i>. While this word usually denotes sheep it can refer to goats too. In some contexts some English versions translate this word as “animal". For instance in <s>00201200500002</s> the Hebrew text is best translated as “It must be an animal (<i>seh</i>) without defect, a one year old male; you may choose it either from your sheep or from your goats."</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The text itself will often indicate the kinds of animal being referred to. In these contexts the translation is not usually difficult. However, when <i>‘eder</i> is used without indication of what animals are intended, in many languages it is best to translate this word by a phrase meaning “herds of domestic animals” or “herds of animals which people raise".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Similarly with <i>ts’on</i>, the context often indicates whether sheep or goats are being referred to. However, where this word occurs without further clarification, it is best translated as “flocks of sheep and goats".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The translation of <i>seh</i> is not quite so straightforward. In some contexts it is best rendered “one animal", in others “one sheep or goat", and in others “a sheep". In languages in which there are different noun classes or classifiers for large and small animals, the appropriate one for an animal the size of a sheep or goat should be used when translating <i>seh</i> as “animal".</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0913_wild_ass"/>Two species of wild ass were known by the Israelites, the Nubian Wild Ass <i>Asinus asinus africanus</i>, which lived on the African side of the Red Sea, and the Persian Wild Ass or Onager <i>Equus hemionus</i>, which was common in the land of Israel, Syria, and Mesopotamia. It seems likely that the Hebrew <i>‘arod</i> and the Aramaic <i>‘arad</i> refer to the Nubian wild ass, and the Hebrew <i>pere’</i> to the onager.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Nubian wild ass is probably the ancestor of virtually all domestic donkeys. It is a smallish, light brown donkey with a characteristic dark stripe down its spine and across its shoulders. It originally had stripes on the lower part of its forelegs. It has long ears and a tufted tail. It is still found in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0683_onager"/>The onager, or Persian wild ass, is a larger animal, classified scientifically as a species of horse. It looks something like a mule. The scientific name <i>hemionus</i> means “half-ass". It has smaller ears than a typical donkey. It is a fawn color but has a whitish chest and belly. It was evidently never fully domesticated, although one ancient Sumerian illustration shows onagers harnessed to a chariot. Onagers are still found in very small numbers in parts of Syria and Iraq and have been reintroduced into Israel.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In Africa the closest equivalent to the wild ass is the zebra, which is about the same size and belongs to the same animal family. Like the onager, the zebra has never been widely domesticated. Where the phrase “wild donkeys” would refer to domestic donkeys that have returned to living in a wild state ("feral donkeys"), a phrase meaning “wild horse” is a better choice, since feral donkeys are easily captured and domesticated, whereas feral horses are harder to domesticate. Languages that use the same word for horse and zebra may still have a problem.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The same word or expression can be used for both Hebrew words and for the Aramaic <i>‘arad</i>, since no distinction between the wild ass species is intended in the biblical text, except in <s>01803900500014</s>. In this verse, the Hebrew <i>pere’</i> and <i>‘arod</i> are both used:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Who set the wild horse (<i>pere’</i>) free?</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Who untied the ropes of the wild ass (<i>‘arod</i>)?</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The parallelism can be preserved either by using a pronoun in the second line (Who untied its ropes?) or by using “zebra” or “wild horse” for <i>pere’</i> and “wild ass” for <i>‘arod</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>There is general agreement about the meaning of the Latin word <i>aper</i>.

            <Paragraph>Although wild boars are the ancestors of domestic pigs, they are much more active and robust animals. They are taller, almost a meter (3 feet) at the shoulder, and much more hairy all over. Their underside is covered in hairs longer than those on the rest of their body. Their color varies from gray to black. Adult males have short tusks that are used both for digging and for protection. They have flat mobile snouts that are also used for digging. The piglets, up to twelve in a litter, are covered with dark stripes and spots running from head to tail. The adults are extremely protective of the younger animals and are fearlessly aggressive. This makes them very dangerous animals. Wild boars are omnivorous, eating mainly roots, but also eating grass, leaves, insects, and small animals and birds. They need to live close to water, as they rely on the cooling effects of wallowing in mud to regulate their body temperature. In Israel they were found in the Huleh swamps, and even now they can be found in the Jordan Valley and in some remote wadis.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Wild pigs similar to <i>Sus scrofa</i> are found in Africa and Asia. They include the Giant Forest Hog <i>Hylochoerus meinertzerhageni</i> of the equatorial regions of Africa; the Bush Pig <i>Potamochaerus porcus</i>, found in the savannah areas of sub-Saharan Africa; and the Crested Wild Boar (Soor) <i>Sus cristatus</i>, found on the Indian subcontinent, and in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and southwestern China. All of these share the aggressive nature of the wild boar.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In Indonesia and some Philippine islands the nearest equivalent is the Babirusa <i>Babyrousa babyrussa</i>. However, since this animal is not nearly as large or as fierce as the wild boar, translations in these areas should probably use an expression meaning “big, fierce babirusa".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the southern United States, Mexico, and adjacent areas of Latin America as far south as southern Brazil and Paraguay, the closest equivalent to the wild boar is the animal known as the collared peccary, javelina, or Musk Hog <i>Tayassu angulatus</i>. This animal is not as large or as fierce as the wild boar, so a more descriptive expression such as “big, fierce peccary” might be the best way of translating the word.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>While <s>01908001301000</s> has the word <i>chazir</i>, normally translated “pig", the context makes it clear that this is a wild animal, and “wild boar” is the better translation.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0047_aurochs"/>Since the beginning of the twentieth century <i>re’em</i> has been translated as “wild ox” in English versions, following the original suggestion made by Canon Tristram in the previous century. However, there are problems connected with this rendering. The usual justifications for this translation are a) that the Akkadian equivalent word <i>rimu</i> refers to the wild ox or Aurochs <i>Bos primigenius</i>, which was frequently hunted by Akkadian kings and b) that wild ox or aurochs fits the description of the wild untameable animal referred to in the Bible.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Both of these arguments have weaknesses from a zoological point of view and the linguistic argument is also debatable. Firstly, the aurochs hunted by the Akkadian kings was an animal found in high rainfall areas with forests. In historical times it was found only in the wooded areas of central and southeastern Europe Armenia (including the southern coastland of the Black Sea) and Mesopotamia. The only aurochs remains found in the land of Israel and the Arabian Peninsula date from the early Pleistocene Age. It is highly unlikely that this animal lived in Israel in biblical times.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Secondly, while the Akkadian <i>rimu</i> is usually translated as “wild ox", the Ugaritic <i>rum</i> has been translated by some scholars as “buffalo", and the Old Arabic <i>rim</i> is usually translated as “oryx". Both of these words are related to the Hebrew <i>re’em</i>. Some scholars have argued that the <i>re’em</i> is really the oryx.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Furthermore, while the wild aurochs was very large, dangerous, and strong, it was not really “untameable". Its dependence on water made it fairly easy to capture in nets and it was domesticated very early. It is the ancestor of all short-horned European cattle. Ancient pictures carved in limestone found in the excavations at Kujunjik in Iraq show carts being pulled by cattle that look exactly the same as the aurochs pictured in hunting scenes from an earlier period.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>An animal similar to the aurochs was hunted by early Egyptian kings but it had disappeared from Egypt as early as the reign of Rameses III (about 1190 B.C.), who hunted instead “wild ox” (probably the Cape buffalo) in forested areas of the Sudan, where there is no evidence that the aurochs ever lived. (A commemorative painting of one of these hunts clearly shows aurochs-like animals being hunted from chariots, but this may be artistic license or a traditional stereotype-the lions in similar paintings are certainly fanciful stereotypes.)</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Among the many animal mummies found in Egypt there are a number of bubal or red hartebeest and Cape buffalo. Both of these animals fit the biblical description of “wild ox", and the hartebeest certainly lived in Arabia and the land of Israel.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Septuagint translates <i>re’em</i> as <i>monokerōs</i> which literally means “one-horned” (hence the <a>KJV</a> “unicorn") but is the ancient Greek word for rhinoceros. This translation needs to be taken seriously, because of its early date. The rhinoceros would have been an animal known to the Jews, since it was found in parts of Egypt. The ancient naturalist, Strabo of Amasia, who lived in the early part of the first century A.D., describes a rhinoceros that he saw in Egypt and refers to another naturalist of the time who had also described this animal. A variety of rhinoceros was found in Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia at the time of the Exodus, and a second variety was found in Mesopotamia.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>At the time of the Exodus then, the aurochs would have been found in the forests of southeast Europe, the far north of Asia Minor, and Mesopotamia, but not in Egypt, Canaan, the Arabian Peninsula, Sinai, or Syria. However, the oryx and the bubal hartebeest would have been plentiful and well known, and the Cape buffalo and rhinoceros would have been known too, at least by hearsay.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There is another aspect of the question that needs to be kept in mind. Throughout human history large, prominent animals have had symbolic importance, even in societies that would never have seen the animal. Thus the lion has been important in Chinese and British culture for centuries, but there is no evidence that lions have ever lived in China or Britain. Thus the aurochs, while it may be a rather improbable interpretation, cannot be ruled out entirely.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Four things can be said for certain about the <i>re’em</i>. It was a wild, untameable animal, it had horns, it was very strong, and it was appropriate to contrast or compare it with domestic cattle and with lions.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><b>Aurochs:</b> The Aurochs <i>Bos primigenius</i>, which is now extinct, was a very large animal, with prominent forward-pointing horns. It looked very similar to the bulls used in Spain for bull-fighting in modern times, but it was probably even larger. The bulls were dark brown or black, with a pale stripe down the spine, while the females were a lighter brown. The German zoos of Berlin, Munich, and Frankfurt have been fairly successful in genetic engineering experiments that have been aimed at reintroducing the aurochs’ original genetic characteristics, by selective breeding from domestic cattle that have the required characteristics. The resulting animals seem to resemble closely the original aurochs.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0104_cape_buffalo"/><b>Cape Buffalo</b>: The Cape Buffalo <i>Syncerus caffer</i> is also a very large animal not as tall as the aurochs but heavier. It is found wherever there is adequate water supply all over sub-Saharan Africa. It prefers thick bush or riverine forest in which to take cover during the day. It has very thick horns that emerge from a broad boss on its forehead then sweep sideways and down before curving sharply upward toward the head. The males have thicker horns than the females. The skin is covered in short hair that varies from black to gray or brown and is usually covered with dry mud so that the buffaloes look the same color as the local soil.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Cape buffaloes live in large herds often numbering over five hundred animals. They are extremely strong cunning and fearless and are probably the most dangerous animals in Africa. Although they have become accustomed to man in some protected areas they are unpredictable and easily provoked. Unlike the Asian water buffalo or carabao the Cape buffalo has never been domesticated.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0757_rhinoceros"/><b>Rhinoceros</b>: The rhinoceros found in Mesopotamia in biblical times was a subvariety of the Great Indian Rhinoceros <i>Rhinoceros unicornis</i> while the variety found in Egypt and Sudan would have been the Hook-lipped or Black Rhinoceros <i>Diceros bicornis</i>. The hook-lipped rhinoceros weighs up to 2000 kilograms (4400 pounds) and is about 1.7 meters (70 inches) tall at the shoulder. It has two horns above the nose, one behind the other, the front one growing over half a meter (20 inches) in length. They live in bushy country and feed on leaves and twigs. They are solitary animals with poor eyesight and are very aggressive. The great Indian rhinoceros was even larger and had a single horn.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Because of the uncertainty of identifying this animal, it is probably best to have an equivalent of “wild ox” or “wild bull” in the text and indicate in a footnote, each time the word is translated, that the word may mean “buffalo” and that the Septuagint has “rhinoceros".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A problem in many countries is that using a phrase like “wild ox” suggests that this is a domestic ox that has gone wild. For this reason, it may be better to use a local name for a large strong, horned animal.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0255_gaurs"/>In Africa the obvious equivalent is the buffalo, and this choice is strengthened by the fact that <i>re’em</i> may even mean “buffalo".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0073_bison"/>In the Indian subcontinent, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and western China, there is an animal (now nearly extinct) known as the Gaur <i>Bibos gaurus</i>. In Thailand it is called the <i>ngua-kating</i>, and in Malaysia, the <i>seladang</i>. It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the “wild water buffalo". This is a type of wild ox very similar to the aurochs. In the Himalayas and mountains of western China there is another smaller animal similar to a wild ox called the Takin <i>Budorcas taxicolor</i>. Another possibility in the Himalayas and Central Asia is an expression meaning “wild yak".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In North America the Bison or American Buffalo <i>Bison bison</i> is the closest equivalent. Another possible equivalent in some Arctic regions is the Musk Ox <i>Ovibos moschatus</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Elsewhere a transliteration or a word borrowed from a locally dominant language is a possible solution.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0922_wolf"/>There is no problem in identifying the Hebrew word with the Wolf <i>Canis lupus</i>, which was a common wild animal all over the land of Israel in the biblical period. Today it is almost extinct in Israel, but small numbers still exist in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. The Greek and Latin words are general words for the wolf, including European species as well as the Syrian one.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The wolf is the ancestor of the German shepherd dog, and all similar breeds. The Syrian wolf, however, unlike the European and North American breeds, does not have long thick fur. It is a light brown color with a typical long face, and it is about the size of the German shepherd dog. It looks similar to the jackal, but is much bigger. This type of wolf lived singly, in pairs, or occasionally in a small family group of three or four animals; but sometimes, when prey was scarce, neighboring wolves would come together temporarily to hunt in cooperation with each other. The varieties in North America and Europe, on the other hand, come together in packs in the winter and stay together until well into the spring.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In biblical times the Syrian wolf took hares, small gazelle, and partridges as its main prey, but it was also a constant threat to sheep and goats. Only extremely rarely would it attack a human being. It was nowhere near as dangerous to humans as the lion or the bear. On the other hand, the Syrian wolf was not afraid of humans, and once it had killed a sheep, it would fiercely protect its kill. A group of men was required if it was to be chased away. It was extremely clever at avoiding traps that had been set for it. It hunted at night and located other wolves early in the evening by howling loudly.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>These wolves did not stay in one area but roamed constantly. Shepherds could thus never be confident that there were no wolves nearby. They could appear unexpectedly at any time, even in the villages where they were often mistaken for dogs.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>To the biblical writers the wolf was a symbol of roaming, opportunistic, dangerous, fierce, and clever banditry. To refer to a person as a wolf would in some contexts indicate that he was a roaming, clever bandit, and in other contexts that he was a clever, dangerous opportunist. This latter usage usually referred to someone using a position of leadership for his own benefit at the expense of other people.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In Africa there are no wolves, but the Spotted Hyena <i>Crocula crocuta</i>, the Brown Hyena <i>Hyaena brunnea</i>, or the African Painted Hunting Dog <i>Lycaon pictus</i> are the local equivalents used in many translations. A problem with using these terms for the Syrian wolf is that these African animals may have a symbolic significance for the local readers which is very different from that intended by the biblical writers. For instance, the spotted hyena is associated with witchcraft in some societies. In cases where the local significance is sufficiently different, a footnote should be used to provide a guide to the readers.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In Argentina and Brazil the beautiful Maned Wolf <i>Chrysocyon jubatus</i> is a good local equivalent, or the Portuguese or Spanish words for wolf can be used. The coyote is another possible equivalent.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In India and in Central and Southeast Asia, the Indian (or red) wild dog, also known as the Dhole <i>Cuon alpinus</i>, is likewise a good local equivalent for the wolf.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In areas where there are no animals equivalent to wolves, a phrase like “large wild dog” can be used, or a word may be borrowed from the dominant language of the area.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00104902700004</s>: Three of the attributes of the wolf are associated with the tribe of Benjamin here. The first is the word often translated by the archaic English word “ravening". This word literally means “tearing prey apart", and so <a>RSV</a> ’s “ravenous", which in modern English means simply “very hungry", is very weak. <a>TEV</a> ’s “vicious” is much better. The second attribute is “devouring the prey", which focuses on greed, and the third is “snatches a share” (<a>REB</a>) which emphasizes the opportunism. Since wolves hunt at night, the “snatching” occurs before the “devouring", although the order is reversed in the Hebrew poetry. In many languages it is better style to use wording that retains the proper sequence. The translation should thus convey the meaning of the following:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Benjamin is a wolf that viciously tears its prey apart;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the evening he snatches away his share,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the morning he is still eating greedily.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>00700702501000 H00700800301000 H01908301101000</s> the word <i>ze’ev</i> is a proper name, possibly of a desert bandit chief.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02400500600014 H03500100800018 H03600300300014</s>: <a>KJV</a> ’s “evening wolves” is better read “wolves from the desert” or “wolves from the plain". The Hebrew is taken by many scholars to mean “wolves of the Aravah". The Aravah is the name of the broad rift valley that runs south from the Dead Sea almost to the Gulf of Aqaba, but the word can also mean a desert plain.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>04000701701000</s>: The well-known expression in English “wolves in sheep’s clothing” has been a problem for many translators, since sheep do not wear clothes. The meaning is obviously “wolves disguised as sheep", “wolves trying to look like sheep", or “wolves pretending to be sheep".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>04402002900018</s>: In this verse Paul is speaking metaphorically. The “fierce wolves” are unscrupulous and opportunistic people who will use their leadership positions in the congregation for their own gain, without thought for the congregation’s own welfare.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>tsippor</i> generally refers to small birds about the size of the sparrow, while the word <i>‘ayit</i>, where it refers to a bird and not an animal, refers to any large bird of prey. In the New Testament the Greek word <b>orneon</b> refers to birds of prey, but in the deuterocanonical books this word is used to refer to birds in general. In the books of Maccabees the word for birds of prey is <i>oiōnobrōtos</i>. The remaining Hebrew and Greek words are all used for birds in general, and if the size or type of bird is important, the specific type is indicated by the individual context. The Latin word <i>volatilis</i> is also a general word for birds of all kinds.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Birds, especially birds of prey, are often, but not always, used in Scripture as symbols of uncleanness or disaster. This seems to be related to the fact that in warfare, the unburied corpses of the dead are fed on by vultures, eagles, and crows.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In some languages the word for birds of prey may be quite different from the word for birds that are eaten, such as partridges, pheasants, chickens, jungle fowl, ducks, geese, and others, and these in turn may be referred to by a different word from the one used for small birds that are not normally eaten. In languages where this is the case, careful attention should be paid to the individual contexts to make sure that the most suitable word is being used.</Paragraph>

    <Title>Birds, clean and unclean</Title>
    <Intro />
    <Index />
    <Sections>
        <Section>
          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The basic principle in classifying animals and birds as clean or unclean was that if they ate unclean food they were themselves unclean. In cases of doubt about what they ate, they were also unclean. Thus a bird was unclean if it ate blood or meat with blood in it, garbage, unclean water creatures, or unclean insects. In addition, any bird that was associated with Egyptian or Canaanite gods, or that seemed somehow “unnatural” was also unclean.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Thus in the list of unclean birds we would expect to find eagles, vultures, and all other birds of prey such as buzzards, falcons, and hawks, scavengers like crows, kites, and seagulls, owls, storks, herons, and kingfishers, especially those that eat frogs, lizards, and snakes. Since the ibis was associated with Egyptian deities and eats worms and tadpoles, we would expect it too to be classified as unclean. Owls would be doubly unclean since they too were associated with an Egyptian god. Furthermore, knowing that ancient Israelites believed that bats, although classified as birds, were the unnatural offspring of a bird and a rat, we could expect bats also to be unclean.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However, we would not expect seed-eating or vegetarian birds to be considered unclean unless they were associated with heathen gods.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Unfortunately, in the biblical lists, there are many Hebrew words that are of very debatable meaning. Apart from a few, we are dealing only with <u>probable</u> rather than certain meanings. The following charts compare the lists in the various versions, omitting the <a>TEV</a> which summarizes the twenty Hebrew words with fifteen in English. The first line in each chart gives the meaning of the word in modern Hebrew. The last line in each chart (ERH) represents the author’s own suggestion, based on a comparison of the English versions, ornithological checklists, commentaries, and other literature that discusses the linguistic derivation of the bird names. The merits of each suggestion are discussed in detail in the sections relating to the individual birds in the author’s suggested list.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In making decisions about the identity of these birds, one important factor that has been a guide is the organization of the list. The lists were obviously given to be memorized, and it is likely that they were arranged in a way that would help memorization. G. R. Driver used a similar method in his studies of these lists and was guided by what he believed was a descending order of size, so that bigger birds were mentioned before smaller ones within each general family. He decided that the three parts of the list were made up of fifteen land birds, three water birds, and two miscellaneous birds. Thus when facing a choice, he would opt for a bird smaller than the previous birds in that section of the list. However, the results of his method are sometimes very debatable, particularly as they presuppose that rather small differences between different types of owl would have been common knowledge.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The list suggested below is equally plausible in terms of the ornithology of the area, and it automatically results in a well organized list with a structure of a type found frequently in Hebrew literature, known as an “envelope."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Charts demonstrating the structures are given below the lists, and a discussion follows the charts.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>As mentioned above, the list we are suggesting has the “envelope” arrangement that is so common in Hebrew texts, probably as an aid to memorization. In an envelope structure, the ideas are introduced in a sequence up to a midpoint, and then similar ideas are introduced in reverse order. At each point, there is some similarity between the corresponding items on both sides of the midpoint. The following charts show the structures:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="fauna-table6_en"/></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Each name in the list probably refers to a particular bird as representing a group of similar birds. The list begins with the two largest birds of prey, vultures and eagles. Then follows a group of three birds of prey, each of which is smaller than the previous bird on the list—the smaller bearded vulture, the kite, and all kinds of falcon or hawk. Then comes all kinds of raven or crow in a group on its own, marking a transition in the list from the birds of prey to owls.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The next group consists of two owls, with the largest owl of all, the eagle owl first, followed by the slightly smaller eared owl. Then follows the seagull, in a group on its own, marking a transition to the midpoint.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The midpoint is formed by a group of two, all kinds of (sparrow) hawk and the little owl. These represent the smallest birds of prey and the smallest owls.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Then comes the osprey on its own, paired with the seagull in the envelope structure of the list, marking a transition back to a group of two more owls, the tawny owl and the barn owl. This group corresponds to the previous group of two owls. This time, however, the smaller is mentioned first, as one would expect on this side of the midpoint.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Then comes the jackdaw (or pelican or some other owl) on its own, corresponding to the crow on its own. If the modern Hebrew <i>qa’ak</i> (jackdaw) is accepted as the equivalent of the biblical <i>qa’at</i>, (since the name is representative of the sound the bird makes, this is a strong argument), rather than “pelican” or “owl,” the correspondence to “crow” is even more marked. This pairing is also seen in <s>02303401101000</s> and <s>03600201401000</s>. The “jackdaw” marks a transition to waterside birds, just as the crow also marked a transition.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The waterside birds are in a group of three, corresponding to the three birds of prey mentioned above. Again, the smallest is mentioned first. While the Egyptian vulture is a bird of prey, it can be found scavenging on beaches, eating eggs of many of the waterside birds. It has a beak that resembles the beaks of many large seabirds, such as the albatross, shearwater, skua, and booby. Its posture when standing is also very similar to a gull’s, and from a distance it looks just like a large gull. It possibly represents all black-and-white waterside birds, since <i>racham</i> seems to be derived from a root meaning “black and white."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>All kinds of heron probably represents all large waterside birds with big beaks, including the ibis and the cormorant, since the word <i>’anafah</i> seems to be derived from a root meaning “nose."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The final group of two is a miscellaneous group consisting of the hoopoe and the bat, which is classified here as a bird.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The inclusion of the ostrich in the list in some versions is highly unlikely, since ostriches are vegetarian and classified as clean. Their disappearance from Palestine is directly attributable to the fact that they were hunted and trapped for food.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0096_buzzard"/><s>00501401101000-00501401801000</s>: This list in the Hebrew Bible is basically the same as the list in Leviticus, with the addition of one extra bird called <i>ra’ah</i> and two slightly different spellings (<i>da’ah</i> becomes <i>dayah</i>, and <i>racham</i> becomes <i>rachamah</i>). This addition is treated as a scribal error in <a>NEB</a>, <a>JB</a>, <a>NAB</a>, and <a>REB</a>, since in Hebrew <i>ra’ah</i> and <i>da’ah</i> look so much alike that it would be easy to read one for the other. <a>KJV</a> translates ra’ah as “glede,” <a>RSV</a> as “buzzard,” and <a>NIV</a> as “falcon."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the Hebrew text the list in Deuteronomy has a different arrangement from the list in Leviticus; the reason for the difference seems to be the additional bird. It is here located in the first group of medium-sized birds of prey, increasing the number of birds in the group from three to four. This group of four is matched by four birds in the corresponding group of waterside birds. The word for osprey <i>shalak</i> is here located within the group of waterside birds. The pattern of the list, however, is not as symmetrical as the Leviticus list, since there is now no word balancing the word for seagull. Finally, the order of the words for kite and falcon is reversed, as can be seen from the following chart:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="fauna-table7_en"/></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If we accept the majority opinion that <i>ra’ah</i> is a scribal error, and thus omit it from the list, then it would seem to be best also to return the list to its original structure as found in Leviticus, as is done in some major translations. If we keep <i>ra’ah</i>, then we can only guess at the meaning of the word from its position in the list, and “buzzard” would seem to be a reasonable guess.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In parts of the world where there are local equivalents for most of the birds on the list, as in many parts of Africa, it is recommended that the translators try to find an equivalent for each of the birds. Elsewhere it is better to try and find more general expressions that would include all of the birds on the list. This is what has been attempted in the <a>TEV</a>. Thus a general list such as the following would be acceptable where there are insufficient equivalents:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>"All kinds of large and small vultures, eagles, hawks, kites, and crows; all kinds of large and small owls; all kinds of large and small herons; all other kinds of bird which eat unclean things; and all bats."</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>There is considerable doubt about the meaning of the word <i>sekwi</i>. However, the rendering “cock” or “rooster” has support from the Vulgate and one of the Targums, as well as the majority of commentaries. In the context of <s>01803803600024</s> the reference seems to be to the way in which the ibis is able to announce the flooding of the Nile, and the rooster is able to announce the coming of the dawn (compare <a>JB</a> and <a>TEV</a>). Both of these abilities are mentioned quite often in Egyptian literature.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>zarzir</i> is probably related to a word meaning “narrow waisted,” but most commentaries and translations interpret this as a reference to the rooster.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek word <i>ornis</i> and the Latin word <i>gallina</i> mean “hen,” and the Greek words <i>nossia</i> and <i>nossion</i> mean “chick,” that is, a baby fowl.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>All modern domestic fowls are descended from the jungle fowl of India, Southeast Asia, and China. These were domesticated very early in the history of that region, almost as soon as the farming of rice and other grains began. According to the Talmud, it was forbidden to keep domestic poultry in Jerusalem, but there is evidence from ancient Hebrew seals that chickens were known in the land as early as 600 B.C. The reference to the cock crowing on the night of the crucifixion would indicate that chickens were kept near, if not in, Jerusalem.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0767_rooster"/>Ancient domestic fowls would still have looked very much like the Jungle Fowl <i>Gallus gallus</i> from which they were descended. Jungle fowl roosters are dark, brownish red, with orange-red neck hackles, a smallish red comb on the top of their heads, and red lappets on each side under the beak. They have a white spot on their backs near the base of their long glossy black and green tails. The hens are a lighter brownish red, have no white spot or long tail, and have a smaller comb on their heads. See also <l target="FAUNA:3.9">3.9 Goose</l>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Domestic fowl had connotations of fertility to the Egyptians and Persians. This seems to have been adopted later in Judaism, since it became the practice to carry a cock and a hen in front of the bride and groom at a wedding. However, their significance in the Bible seems related to the fact that cocks crow very early in the morning, thus announcing the coming dawn before humans are aware of it.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Domestic fowl have now spread around the world and are well-known, apart from some areas of the tundra region.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The words <i>sekwi</i>, <i>zarzir</i>, <i>alektruōn</i>, and <i>alektōr</i> are probably best translated as “rooster,” <i>ornis</i> (in the passages listed above, but not elsewhere) as “hen,” and <i>nossion</i> and <i>nossia</i> as “chickens.” In some languages where roosters and hens are not normally differentiated, it may not be necessary to do so in the gospel passages, since the verb “crow” will usually be sufficient context to make the meaning clear. However, in the Job and Proverbs passages it may still be necessary in some languages to say something like “male chicken."</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0153_cormorants"/>Although the translation of <i>shalak</i> as “cormorant” has a tradition going back to the seventeenth century, there has always been considerable doubt about this translation. For one thing, the root of the word <i>shalak</i> means “to throw or hurl", which would indicate that the bird with this name “throws” itself down onto its prey, something cormorants do not do. They swim low in the water and dive underwater to hunt their prey. This led the late G. R. Driver to suggest the translation “fisher owl", and this has been followed by <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a>. However, there are problems with this suggestion too. The fisher owl, or more correctly, the Brown Fish Owl “Scotopelia ceylonensis", is not likely to have been a bird that was well known, and its fishing habits would only have been seen by fishermen on moonlit nights, and that very rarely. The Israelites were not yet a fishing people in the period of the Exodus.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In modern Hebrew <i>shalak</i> is the name given to the Osprey <i>Pandion haliaetus</i>, which is a type of fishing eagle that plunges into the water from a height and catches fish in its claws. Some Israeli scholars have suggested that it may have been the ancient name for the Smyrna Kingfisher <i>Halcyon smyrnensis</i>, or the Gannet <i>Sula bassana</i>, both of which drop down from a height onto their prey, which they catch underwater in their beaks.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Since there is so much doubt about the identification of this bird, the translation “osprey” seems to have as much, if not more, justification than “cormorant".</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The White-necked Cormorant <i>Phala-crocorax carbo</i>, which is the most common type of cormorant in the Middle East, is a large bird with a long slim body and a long beak that is hooked at the tip. The adults are black all over with a small yellow pouch where the throat meets the beak. They also have yellow skin on their faces. This type of cormorant is found along the sea and lake coasts, along the larger rivers, and in swampy areas. It has webbed feet like a duck and swims in the water, but with most of the body under the water. It dives and can swim quite a long way underwater hunting fish.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Like all cormorants its feathers are not waterproof, and this enables it to swim underwater easily. However, it also means that after diving or swimming for a while, a cormorant has to come out of the water to dry out its wings. Thus cormorants can often be seen perched on logs or rocks, with their wings spread out to dry.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>During the daytime they can usually be found in small groups of four or five, but in the evening when they roost in trees they come together in large numbers and are very noisy. In seasons when large shoals of small fish swim near the surface, large numbers of black cormorants can often be seen flying fast and low above the water in long lines one behind the other, searching for such a shoal. When they find it, they all land on the water together and feed in great excitement.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>If the translator chooses to identify <i>shalak</i> as “cormorant", it should not be difficult to find some species of cormorant locally, since cormorants are found all over the world near large bodies of water. The white-necked cormorant is in fact found not only in Israel but also near the coasts, lake shores, large rivers, and swamps throughout Europe, Asia, Australasia, Africa, and the eastern half of North America. In southern Africa a slightly different form of the white-necked cormorant is found, called the white-breasted cormorant. It has a white breast and throat and a smaller throat pouch, but has the same scientific name. Elsewhere there will be local species of cormorant, which can be identified by the habit of perching with wings spread out to dry.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0160_cranes"/>The occurrence of this word in <s>02303801400006</s> is problematic, where it appears in the phrase <i>sus ‘agur</i>, which looks like a head noun followed by a qualifying noun, so it is the name of a single bird (a type of swift) rather than of two. The phrase is thus translated as “swallow” by <a>NEB</a>, <a>JB</a>, <a>REB</a>, and <a>NAB</a>, but as two birds by <a>KJV</a>, <a>RSV</a>, and <a>NIV</a>. (The <a>KJV</a> translators seem to have reversed the order of the two birds, giving “crane or a swallow".) In <s>02400800700030</s>, however, all versions treat the word as a common noun, although interpreting it differently.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The interpretation in Jeremiah of <i>‘agur</i> as “crane” has quite good support. For one thing the crane is one of the most obvious of the migrating birds passing over Israel, and thousands can be seen passing noisily overhead each year as they move from Europe and Asia to Africa for the summer and return again in March. They stay in Israel only for a few days and then move on. Second, the translation “crane” neatly preserves the structure and the images of the Hebrew poem. The structure here is what is referred to as a chiasmus. In this chiasmus four items are mentioned, with the first and last forming one pair and the middle two forming another: stork, dove, swift, crane. This is a common feature of Hebrew poetry. Here “stork” and “crane” are paired, and since both are passing migrants and both have long necks and legs and are about the same size, the pairing is well motivated. Third, but perhaps less important, <i>‘agur</i> is the modern Hebrew word for crane. Some Hebrew scholars relate the word to the verb <i>ga‘ar</i>, “to cry", a reference to the noisy call of the crane.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The translations “thrush” (<a>NIV</a>, <a>TEV</a>) and “wryneck” (<a>NEB</a>, <a>REB</a>) result in a very poor poetic structure for the verse. Furthermore, while both of these small birds are migrants, their arrival in Israel is hardly noticeable, since they arrive in ones and twos and not in flocks. The wryneck is a passing migrant that stays only a short time in Israel. Even though some have argued that the song of the song thrush would be sufficient to announce its arrival, it should be borne in mind that this thrush sings mostly in spring, but it arrives in Israel at the end of autumn.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Cranes are large long-legged, long-necked birds, which are best known for their dancing displays. At breeding time especially, but at other times too, a small group of cranes will start “dancing” together, bobbing up and down, jumping into the air, and turning around. The crane mentioned in <s>02400800700030</s> is most likely the Eurasian or Common Crane <i>Grus grus</i>. This is a large gray bird with a trace of red on the top of its head, and whitish cheeks. It has a wingspan of over two meters (6 feet), a long neck, and long bare legs. It behaves very much like a stork, spending most of its time walking on the ground in search of frogs, lizards, grasshoppers, and other insects.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Song Thrush <i>Turdus philomelos</i> is a light brown bird with a speckled chest. Like most other thrushes, it spends a lot of time on the ground searching for insects and ants. It is solitary or lives in pairs. It has a very beautiful, complicated song made up of a combination of clear whistling notes, trilled notes, and chirps. It lives in wooded areas.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Wryneck <i>Jinx torquilla</i> is a bird similar in appearance to a small woodpecker. It has a mottled coloring with a reddish chest. It feeds on ants and spends most of its time searching for them on the ground or on the branches and trunks of trees. It lives in woods and orchards.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>It is better to translate <i>sus ‘agur</i> in <s>02303801400006</s> as one bird only, namely the swift. See <l target="FAUNA:3.23">3.23 Swallow, swift</l>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Cranes are found worldwide except in South America, New Zealand, and small island localities. In most parts of the world then, it will not be difficult to find a word for one of the local cranes. However, in most parts of the world the local cranes are not migrating birds, but permanently resident. In these cases it may be good to have a footnote indicating that in Israel cranes migrate in large numbers over the land in spring and autumn, moving from Europe and Asia to Africa and back again. Alternatively, in places where two types of migrating stork are known, as in many parts of central, eastern, and southern Africa, the name of one type can be used to translate <i>‘agur</i> in <s>02400800700030</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>African cranes include the Blue Crane <i>Anthropoides paradisea</i>, the Wattled Crane <i>Grus carunculata</i>, and the Crested Crane (also called the Crowned Crane) <i>Balearica regulorum</i>. Australian cranes include the Brolga <i>Grus rubicunda</i> and the Sarus Crane <i>Grus antigone</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Among the Asian cranes is the red-headed Siberian crane, which nests in Siberia and migrates to Iran, Pakistan, India, and China.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, and southeastern Europe, it should be possible to find a local word for the Common Crane <i>Grus grus.</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Elsewhere the best solution is a word for crane borrowed from English, Spanish, or Portuguese, or a transliteration of the scientific name <i>Grus</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Thrushes too are found worldwide, except in New Zealand and Oceania. It should not be difficult to find a local equivalent if the interpretation <i>thrush</i> is followed. Elsewhere a borrowed word or transliteration can be used.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The translation of “wryneck” is more problematic. There are only two species of wryneck, one found in southeastern Europe which migrates to Egypt and one found in some parts of western, eastern, and southern Africa. It is not a very common bird. The translation “crane” would be preferable from a translational as well as an exegetical point of view.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0165_crow"/>There is no disagreement about the meaning of these words. The Hebrew <i>‘orev</i> and the two Greek words are general names given to any member of the crow family. This includes any of the three types of raven, two types of crow, and the rook, which are found in Israel. Of these the Brown-necked Raven <i>Corvus ruficolllis</i>, the Fan-tailed Raven <i>Corvus rhipidurus</i>, and the Hooded Crow <i>Corvus corone cornix</i> are common residents. (G. S. Cansdale describes the fan-tailed raven as “the rarest of them all,” contrary to the experience of most bird-watchers and the official status given in most checklists of the birds of Israel.) The Common Raven <i>Corvus corax</i> is resident but not as common in modern Israel as it must have been in ancient times. The remaining types of crow found in Israel are visiting migrants that do not stay long.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Crows and ravens are large black birds with thick strong beaks, and fairly short legs. They are highly intelligent and seem to enjoy flying. Often if there is a good thermal current of air, they will soar around in circles, riding the thermal and calling. Some varieties will congregate in great numbers in these thermals and circle around together. On sunny windy days they will sometimes spread their wings and ride the wind, not going anywhere, sometimes even anchoring themselves by hanging on to the end of a branch with one foot. They eat almost anything, including grain, fruit, insects, lizards, frogs, eggs, nestlings, and the meat of dead animals. The <a>NEB</a> translation of <i>‘orev</i> as “magpie” in <s>02003001700022</s> is puzzling, as it is common for ravens and crows to peck out the eyes of dead or dying animals. When the raven released by Noah failed to return to the ark, this was a sign that some land had emerged from the flood and that the raven had found food, probably the carcasses of the people and creatures drowned in the flood.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Crows are also often seen in fields where seed has recently been sown, and farmers in some countries make “scarecrows", which are figures in the shape of human beings or, sometimes, of hawks and eagles. These are made of old sacks stuffed with straw and are all designed to chase the crows away.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Crows and ravens build their nests out of twigs and grass in the forks of trees or on ledges on cliffs. The nests are quite large and untidy. Ravens tend to keep to the rocky hills and are found near Galilee, the Judean Desert, the Dead Sea coast, the Negev, and the escarpment bordering the Aravah Rift Valley.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Ravens are unclean birds and are associated in biblical culture with death. They are thus symbols of the devastation resulting from war. They are also singled out as fed by God (<s>01803804101000</s>). Even though they are unclean and have some horrible habits, they are not forgotten by God. Thus they are also a symbol of God’s kindness. Finally, for the inhabitants of Israel there was nothing blacker than the raven, which in fact is usually glossy as well as black.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Crows and ravens are very widespread around the world. Some types are not all black, but black and white, black and gray, or black and brown. In all there over one hundred species distributed throughout the world. They are usually found in mountainous areas or near towns, but seldom in dense rain forest. In Africa south of the Sahara, the Pied Crow <i>Corvus albus</i> is the most common, but in the mountains of eastern and southern Africa the larger White-necked Raven <i>Corvus albicollis</i> is also found. A relative of the Middle Eastern hooded crow, called the Australian Raven <i>Corvus coronoides</i>, is found in most parts of Australia. The House Crow <i>Corvus splendens</i>, which was originally indigenous to India, has now spread to countries as far away as Australia and South Africa.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In most parts of the world, therefore, except in those rain forest areas that have no towns, there will be local crows or ravens.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01101700400020</s>: Some commentators take the Hebrew word <i>‘orvim</i> to refer to a desert tribe, since the Hebrew word has the same consonants as the word for “Arabs". However, almost all Bible translations retain the traditional interpretation “ravens".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>03600201401000</s>: Most modern translations follow the ancient versions rather than the Hebrew in this verse, reading <i>‘orev</i>, “raven” rather than <i>chorev</i>, “desolation".</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0186_dove"/>In the fifteenth century the English word “pigeon” meant a young dove, the word “dove” being reserved for the adult birds. In modern English the words are used almost interchangeably. As a general rule, “pigeon” is used for domesticated forms of these birds, and for the larger variety of wild forms, while “dove” is used mainly for wild varieties. However, there are many exceptions to this general rule. For instance, shelters built for domestic pigeons are called “dovecotes", and pies made from wild doves are called “pigeon pies".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Pigeons and doves are both included in a bird family known scientifically as the <i>Colombidae</i>, consisting of well over two hundred species. In Israel and the Middle East are found the true <i>Colombidae</i>, which are easily distinguished from the genus <i>Stretopelia</i>, that is, the turtle doves.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The most common of the true <i>Colombidae</i> in the Middle East is most certainly the Asiatic Rock Dove <i>Columba livia</i>. This bird was first domesticated around 4500 B.C. in Mesopotamia. By 2500 B.C. it was kept as a domestic bird in Egypt, and by 1200 B.C. there is evidence that its homing abilities were already well known. It is this bird that is the ancestor of the domestic homing pigeons that people keep, some of which have escaped, returned to the wild, and now populate city streets all over the world. The ledges of modern buildings are a good substitute for the rock ledges that were its original nesting sites. It is likely that the Canaanites and the Israelites also kept these birds for both food and sacrifice. It is this bird that is called <i>yonah</i> in the Hebrew Bible and <u>peristera</u> in the Greek New Testament.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0712_pigeon"/>There are also three types of turtledove found in the land of Israel, two of which are resident species; the third is a migrant that arrives in spring and spends the summer in Israel. This migrant, the true Turtle Dove <i>Streptopelia turtur</i>, and one of the species now resident, the Collared Dove <i>Streptopelia decaocto</i>, are what the Bible writers called <i>tor</i> in Hebrew and <i>trugōn</i> in Greek. (Both the Hebrew and Greek names are based on the sound the turtledove makes.)</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In biblical Hebrew the word <i>gozal</i> generally refers to a nestling of any bird species. In <s>00101500900030</s> it obviously refers specifically to a young pigeon. Nestling rock pigeons were collected from the rock ledges. Pigeons and doves were kept in cages and dovecotes, and wild ones were trapped in nets. This enabled the Jews to have a handy stock of birds for sacrificial purposes.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The rock pigeon is a blue-gray color with a pinkish sheen to the neck feathers. It has a black tip on its tail. Its call is a repeated moaning <i>oom</i> (the Hebrew name <i>yonah</i> is related to a verb meaning “to moan") or a rapid cooing <i>coo-ROO-coo-coo</i>, usually repeated two or three times. The call is uttered with the beak closed, into the chest. The male’s sexual display starts with flying wing claps, and then when it lands next to the female, it begins bowing and turning with chest puffed and tail spread.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This type of pigeon lives in large colonies, and when a group is in flight, they maneuver as a single unit, often gliding short distances together with their wings held in a V shape.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The turtledove is a smaller blue-gray bird with a pinkish chest. It arrives in Israel in April, and its rhythmic call <i>yoo-ROO-coo, yoo-ROO-coo, yoo-ROO-coo</i>, repeated for two or three minutes at a time on sunny days, can be heard all over.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Doves are seed eaters, and this fact may be significant in the Flood narrative. The raven, a carrion eater, does not return to the ark, since food is available. The dove returns at first, and when it finally stays away, this is an indication that seeds of some sort are once again available to it, and the earth is again dry.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>As seed-eaters, doves and pigeons are ritually clean birds for Jews. Their swift flight means that they are symbolic of speed in some biblical contexts, especially in Psalms. The fact that these birds court, mate, and nest repeatedly throughout the year resulted in their being a symbol of affection, sexuality, and fertility in the ancient Egyptian, Canaanite, and Hebrew cultures. This symbolism is important in the Song of Solomon.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A very ancient belief that the dove has no bile and is therefore devoid of anger led to its becoming a symbol of peace and gentleness. (In actual fact doves and pigeons are aggressive, often attacking other birds, especially at food sources.)</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The name <i>yonah</i> for the pigeon and dove is associated with moaning and groaning in pain or sorrow. This is often the symbolism in prophetic poetry.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Pigeons and doves are found worldwide, except in some snow-bound regions and on some remote islands. Almost everywhere they live there is more than one species, and in almost all locations the domestic pigeon is one of these species. As a general rule, the word for the smaller wild dove should be used wherever possible, but in those contexts where both pigeons and doves are mentioned in connection with sacrifices, the word for the domestic pigeon can be used as well as the one for the wild dove.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>01200602500044</s> there is a Hebrew expression that literally means “dove’s dung". This seems to be a reference to some kind of food that is eaten only in emergencies. Suggestions about what this may refer to have varied from “chickpeas” (which do look somewhat like a dove’s droppings) to “locust-beans” (<a>NEB</a>, <a>REB</a>), “wild onions” (<a>JB</a>, <a>TEV</a> footnote, <a>NAB</a>), and the roots of certain wild flowers. In view of the lack of certainty, it is probably best to translate it literally as “dove’s dung” and include the footnote, “This is probably some kind of wild food eaten only in emergencies."</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Vultures and eagles were much more common in the ancient world than they are today. In fact since the end of World War II in 1945 the world’s population of vultures and eagles has been reduced by over sixty percent. This is due mainly to a) calcium deficiencies as a result of eating animals in which there were high concentrations of the insecticide DDT, b) eating poisoned rats, and c) the reduction in the amount of carrion due to both the disappearance of wild animals since the invention of the modern rifle, and the modern garbage disposal systems.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Nesher</i>: As is the case with many Hebrew bird names, the word <i>nesher</i> refers both to one particular bird and to a general class of birds. It seems likely that nesher refers specifically to the largest of the local birds of prey, namely the Griffon Vulture <i>Gyps fulvus</i>, but since this word also refers to large birds of prey, it also has a general reference to all or any of them. Thus this category of large birds probably also includes the Lappet-faced Vulture <i>Torgos tracheliotus negevensis</i>, (now fairly uncommon, but previously very numerous), the Golden Eagle <i>Aquila chrysaetos</i>, the Imperial Eagle <i>Aquila heliaca</i>, the Steppe Eagle <i>Aquila nipalensis</i>, and possibly the Black or Verreaux’s Eagle <i>Aquila verreauxii</i>. The last mentioned bird has only been breeding in modern Israel in the last thirty-five years, but some ornithologists believe that it may have lived there in ancient times, since it is associated closely with the hyrax, its favorite prey. It is not mentioned by Canon Tristram.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>‘Ozniyah</i>: There is considerable doubt about the meaning of this word. Its meaning is basically derived from its position in the list of unclean birds, and this makes a type of vulture more likely than the osprey. Since the Black Vulture <i>Aegypius monachus</i> is slightly smaller than the lappet-faced vulture and the bearded vulture, this seems to be the most likely candidate. It probably represents eagles and buzzards of the same size as itself, that is, some of the eagles mentioned above. In modern Hebrew <i>‘ozniyah</i> is the name for the lappet-faced and black vultures.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>‘Ayit</i>: There is general agreement that the word <i>‘ayit</i> in the Bible is a word that includes in its meaning both eagles and vultures. However, it probably does not include smaller birds of prey, such as the hawk, sparrow hawk, or smaller falcons. In the contexts in which it occurs it is clear that carrion-eating birds of prey are meant, rather than all birds of prey. Therefore the English expression “birds of prey” is too inclusive, but the term “carrion birds", used in some passages in <a>JB</a> and <a>NIV</a>, is probably more correct.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>‘ayit</i> is usually taken to be derived from a Hebrew root meaning “to scream", hence “the screamer", and is obviously a bird in <s>00101501100008</s> and other passages. However, there are also scholars who relate <i>‘ayit</i> to a different Hebrew root meaning “to attack greedily".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In seventeenth century English, the word “fowls” was used for large or adult birds, and “birds” was used for smaller birds or chicks. The verb “to raven” meant to tear meat off a carcass, so the <a>KJV</a> expression “ravenous birds"(<s>02401200900004</s>; <s>02603900400028</s>) did not mean “hungry birds” but rather “birds that tear meat off carcasses".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Peres</i>, a word derived from a Hebrew root meaning “to tear apart” or “to break", probably refers to the Bearded Vulture or Lammergeir <i>Gypaëtus barbatus</i>, which looks much like an eagle. It probably represents a grouping of eagles and vultures slightly smaller than those mentioned above under nesher and would include the Black-breasted Snake Eagle (also called the Short-toed Eagle or the Black-chested Harrier Eagle) <i>Circaetus gallicus</i> (alternatively <i>Circaetus pectoralus</i>) and the Booted Eagle <i>Hieraaetus pennatus</i>, as well as one or two others.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0203_egyptian_vulture"/><i>Racham</i> refers to something that is black and white. The position of the name in the list of unclean birds would indicate that it is a waterside bird. This narrows the choice to two possibilities, the Egyptian Vulture <i>Neophron percnopterus</i> and the Osprey <i>Pandion haliatus</i>. In modern Hebrew <i>racham</i> is the name for the Egyptian vulture, and this seems to be the bird intended by the <a>JB</a> translation “white vulture". <a>KJV</a> ’s “geir-eagle” is an old word for vulture.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Egyptian vulture is smaller than the other vultures mentioned above. It has long, untidy, light orange-brown feathers on its neck and head, with a bare yellow face and yellow beak that is longer and less hooked than most vultures. The rest of the body and wings are white with black wing tips. In flight the body and the front half of the wings are white, with the wing tips and the back half of the wings black.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>While this vulture does eat carrion, it is usually the scraps dropped by larger vultures, since its beak is not strong enough to tear skin and meat easily. It usually scavenges scraps on beaches or rubbish dumps and eats the eggs of ground-nesting waterside birds such as plovers, sandpipers, curlews, and others, which it breaks by knocking them with a large stone.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Aetos</i>: This is the usual Greek word for any kind of eagle.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Aquila</i>: This is the usual Latin word for any kind of eagle.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>True eagles have feathers on the lower part of their legs, but vultures, snake-eagles, hawks, and others usually have no such feathers. Vultures have slightly longer beaks and longer necks than eagles, and their heads and necks are usually either bald or have sparse down covering them rather than proper feathers.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0280_vulture"/><b>Griffon vulture</b>: This is the largest of the <i>Gyps</i> vultures, having a wingspan of about 2.5 meters (8 feet), and weighing up to 10 kilograms (22 pounds). It has a thick hooked black beak. Its head and neck are covered in fine down, and it always looks as though it is frowning. It has a tuft of feathers on its back between its shoulders. The head, neck, and chest are gray and fawn, and its back is dark brown with darker feathers on the edges of its wings. When it is soaring, its body and the leading edges of its wings appear light brown with a broad dark band on the trailing edge of the wings. Like all true vultures, it has featherless legs.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Griffons live in fairly large groups and roost and nest together on high rock ledges, and, like most other vultures of large size, they have to wait until mid-morning when there is warm air rising up from the ground before they can fly. They then soar in spirals, going higher and higher.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>They have very specialized eyes that enable them to see great distances. A proverb quoted in the Talmud says, “A vulture in Babylon sees a carcass in Israel.” They keep watch to find any dead or dying animals, and at the same time they keep track of other vultures flying nearby. They soar fairly slowly, without beating their wings. As soon as one stops spiraling and heads toward its prey, it gathers speed quickly in a shallow dive, still not beating its wings, but often reaching high speeds. The Hebrew name <i>nesher</i> may reflect the swishing sound made by its wings when it is flying this fast. Other vultures will notice this movement and will start to follow.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In African countries where both griffon and lappet-faced vultures live, griffons usually arrive at a carcass in fairly large numbers, with the lappet-faced vultures arriving in pairs. Often a dead cow will attract twenty griffons or more and perhaps four lappet-faced vultures. It is likely that this ratio was the case in ancient Israel too.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The griffons attack the stomach and other soft parts of the carcass and thrust their heads deep into the body to eat the liver and other soft organs before starting on the softer meat, eating “from the inside out.” They eat very quickly and can consume a kilogram (2 pounds) of meat in about two minutes. After gorging themselves it is difficult for them to fly, and they need to run and hop along the ground before getting airborne. If there is no obvious danger, they prefer to remain on the ground or to perch on logs or in nearby trees after eating.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0577_lappet-faced_vulture"/><b>Lappet-faced vulture</b>: This vulture is almost as big as the griffon in terms of height and wingspan but has a lighter build. They live singly or in pairs in the Negev and roost and nest in the tops of flat-topped trees such as acacias. The lappet-faced vulture has a yellowish beak, which is thicker and stronger than that of the griffon, and this enables it to eat skin, sinews, and tough meat. The head, face, and neck are covered with bare red skin. The head and neck have thick wrinkles. The rest of the body is dark brown or black with white thighs and shoulders. When they are soaring they appear to be uniformly black except for a thin white streak on the leading edge of the wings, with the white thighs (usually referred to by bird watchers as their “white pants") clearly visible.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>At a carcass they feed “from the outside in,” tearing the skin and eating it before starting on the meat. Lappet-faced vultures are very aggressive and dominate the griffons at a carcass they are sharing. Although carrion is their main food, they also sometimes kill their own prey, mainly small mammals such as young gazelles or hares.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Black vulture</b>: The black vulture, as its name suggests, is black all over apart from the bare head and neck, which are a bluish gray. When viewed from below it appears completely black.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Large eagles</b>: The golden, imperial, and Verreaux’s eagles mentioned above are all very large and have a wingspan of at least 2 meters (6 feet). They are not mainly scavengers, but may occasionally join vultures at a carcass. Generally their prey is small mammals, such as baby gazelles, lambs, hyraxes, hares, and young ibexes, as well as occasional game birds such as partridges and doves.</Paragraph>
              <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0065_beardedvulture"/><b>Bearded vulture</b>: Also known as the lammergeir, this bird is unique among vultures, as it has feathered legs like an eagle. It is smaller than the vultures mentioned above. Its head, neck, and body are an orange-brown, and it has a black stripe running from the back of its head, through its eye to the beak, where it ends in a short bristly black beard on both sides of the beak. Its back and wings are dark brown. In flight it is easily recognized by its coloring and its large diamond shaped tail. It usually feeds when other vultures have eaten, and it has the unique habit of carrying bones high into the air and then dropping them onto a large rock to break them so that it can eat the marrow and the bone fragments. It will use the same rock for this purpose for many years. This habit led the <a>KJV</a> translators to coin the word “ossifrage” from Latin, meaning “bone breaker".

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Both eagles and vultures are associated with large size and great strength. Especially important is their ability to fly great distances at high speed, without even beating their wings. Both Egyptian and Assyrian deities had the eagle or vulture as their symbol, and this, as well as their diet of meat, meant that these birds were “unclean” to the Jews. The famous mummy of Tutankhamen, the young Egyptian king, was found with a large collar made of gold and colored glass adorning his neck and shoulders, in the form of a flying vulture representing the goddess Nekhbet. The eagle in Scripture is also a symbol of protection, and in Deuteronomy the eagle is a metaphor for God.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>As carrion-eating birds of prey, eagles and vultures symbolized death in battle, in which the corpses were not buried. They are listed among the unclean birds.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The vulture or eagle was a symbol of healthy, long life. In actual fact these birds can live for a great many years. One fairly reliable report from Austria refers to an eagle kept in captivity for 104 years. Some scholars relate the Hebrew association of long life and the eagle to the ancient Arabian myth about the phoenix, usually portrayed as some sort of eagle, which flew to the sun every five hundred years, was consumed by the sun’s fire, and emerged reborn from its own ashes.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>By the time of the New Testament the eagle, besides the symbolism mentioned above, had also become a symbol of the power of the Roman Empire.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The context will usually indicate whether vultures or eagles are intended by the author. When there is reference to speed and swooping down on the prey, the eagle is intended, but when there is reference to eating dead bodies, the vulture is intended. When the text speaks of flying high or nesting in safety on high cliffs, either eagles or vultures fit the context.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Three linguistic situations are possible: a) Languages in which the same word is used for both vultures and eagles (for example, Lisu, Lahu, and other Tibeto-Burman languages). Here there is no need to differentiate between them, except where both Hebrew words appear together. b) Languages in which there are no generic words for vultures or eagles, but each individual subspecies has its own name (as with many southeastern Bantu languages). In these cases it is best to choose the biggest vulture or eagle for <i>nesher</i> and a slightly smaller one for <i>peres</i>. c) Languages in which there are two generic words, one for vultures and another for eagles (as is the case in English). Here the context will determine the choice.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Care should be taken in those contexts where the nest is referred to as high on a cliff face, since some species of vulture and eagle nest in trees. In these cases a cliff-nesting alternative should be chosen, even if it is a smaller bird of prey.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>‘Ozniyah</i> is probably a word for the black vulture or a type of medium-sized eagle. An expression meaning “small vulture” is probably the best equivalent.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Another name for an eagle or vulture of similar size as the black vulture can be used in the lists of unclean birds for <i>‘ozniyah</i>, or it can be included, along with <i>peres</i>, in a general expression covering both fairly large vultures and eagles.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>‘Ayit</i> In languages that do not have a single word including both eagles and vultures, but where both types of bird are found, such as in Africa and the Middle East, it is better to use a simple phrase meaning “eagles and vultures.” A phrase such as “scavenging birds of prey,” or simply “vultures,” could also be used.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>True vultures are not found in the Americas or Australasia, but a word for “buzzards,” or, in the case of the Americas, “condors” can substitute for “vultures.” Elsewhere a phrase such as “eagles that eat dead things” or a borrowed word can be used.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02401200900014</s>: The phrase <i>‘ayit tsavu‘a</i> in this verse is taken by some scholars to mean “speckled bird of prey.” Others take <i>tsavu‘a</i> to mean “hyena” and (taking <i>‘ayit</i> to be derived from a root meaning “attack greedily") they interpret <i>‘ayit tsavu‘a</i> to mean either “greedy/scavenging hyenas,” “prey for hyenas,” or “carrion for hyenas.” These latter interpretations make better sense in the context than “speckled bird of prey.” See <l target="FAUNA:2.19">2.19 Hyena</l>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Translators may at times need to keep local cultural conditioning in mind. In some cultures vultures and eagles carry very different associations in popular thought, the one being considered nasty, dirty, and generally negative, while the other is a symbol of power and nobility. While the latter symbolism is found in Scripture, it is usually associated with the <i>nesher</i>, which most commonly indicates the vulture rather than the eagle. So, for example, one might translate as “I carried you on the wings of vultures” (see the discussion below). However, this would evoke a wrong response from most Western readers. Where such symbolism exists and where the context allows, it will be preferable to render “eagle".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Peres</i>: The bearded vulture is found in the mountainous regions of southern Europe, Central and South Asia, and eastern and southern Africa. The medium-sized short-toed eagle is found throughout Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The booted eagle is found all over Europe, Asia, and Africa. Elsewhere, the name for a medium-sized vulture or eagle can be used to translate <i>peres</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In Africa there are many vultures closely related to the griffon vulture, and the lappet-faced vulture is common in most areas of the African continent. The African griffons include the White-backed Vulture <i>Gyps africanus</i> (alternately <i>Gyps bengalensis</i>), which nests in trees, the Cape Vulture <i>Gyps coprotheres</i>, and Ruppell’s Vulture <i>Gyps ruppelli</i>. The local word for any of these would be a good equivalent in contexts where the text refers to vultures.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Griffons are also found in central and eastern Europe and on the Indian sub-continent. The condors of Latin America and California would be local equivalents. The Wedge-tailed Eagle <i>Aquila audax</i> of Australia would be an equivalent there.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Golden and imperial eagles are found in most of western Europe as well as Israel.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>African equivalents of the golden and imperial eagles would be the Black or Verreaux’s Eagle <i>Aquila verreauxii</i> and the Martial Eagle <i>Polemaetus bellicosus</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Steppe Eagle <i>Aquila nipalensis migrates</i> across Israel to as far south as the northern parts of South Africa. It is also found in eastern Europe, Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and South Asia.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In North America the Bald Eagle <i>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</i> would be an equivalent in some contexts of the Hebrew <i>nesher</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00201900400024</s>: The expression “I carried you on eagles’ wings” (<a>NIV</a>) involves a metaphor that has been taken literally by readers in many languages. However, the text does not mean that eagles carried the Israelites to Sinai. Rather the metaphor refers to God’s protection, speed, and power and means “I brought you here as if I had been a flying eagle carrying you."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Some commentaries have quoted an often repeated but unsubstantiated statement to the effect that the Israelites believed that eagles carry their young on their wings. Some commentaries have even claimed that naturalists have actually seen eagles doing this. There is no independent evidence for this belief apart from two biblical passages of which this is one, and none of the naturalists who have specialized in the observation of eagles has ever reported this kind of behavior. These commentaries have actually misinterpreted the Hebrew idiom “on wings,” which does not mean “on the upper surface of the wings” but rather “in flight."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00502804900030</s>: Since the context indicates that the <i>nesher</i> in this verse is attacking the disobedient nation of Israel rather than devouring the dead nation, the word should be interpreted as a large eagle (<a>RSV</a>, <a>JB</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>TEV</a>, <a>NAB</a>) rather than as a vulture (<a>NEB</a>, <a>REB</a>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00503201001000 H00503201100004 H00503201201000</s>: There are a number of problems in verse 11. In the Hebrew poem verses 10 and 11 are closely linked, so that the main thought of verse 10 is continued in verse 11. In verse 10 the last three verbs are “shielded or, encircled, cared for, guarded.” In this context the translation of verse 11 as “stirs up its nest” (<a>RSV</a>, <a>NIV</a>) is not likely. “Watches over its nest” (<a>NEB</a>, <a>JB</a>, <a>REB</a>) is a better exegesis, but this verb is often translated elsewhere as encourage so “encourages its nestlings” is entirely possible (see <a>NAB</a>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>All of the English versions misrepresent how an eagle teaches its young to fly, probably because they accept the hypothetical myth mentioned above, namely that eagles carry their young on their wings.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>What actually happens is that young eagles are shown by their parents how to set their wings by spreading them when the wind blows, while holding on to the side of the nest. Eventually when the young eagles have mastered this, they let go and ride the wind out of the nest. At this stage the parent eagles are usually nearby, circling overhead.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew text, if the myth hypothesis is rejected, is actually open to a very different interpretation that is in accordance with what really happens. This interpretation has some scholarly support, but has not yet been mentioned in any commentary or translation. It involves interpreting the last verb in verse 11 as meaning “lifts himself up” rather than “is lifted up.” The following model gives this interpretation:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><sup>10</sup>He found him in a desert land,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>in a barren howling waste.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>He circled around him, cared for him,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>guarded him like the apple of his eye.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><sup>11</sup>Like an eagle encouraging its nestling,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>hovering over its offspring,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>spreading its wings, instructing him,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>until he rises up on his strong wings,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><sup>12</sup>Yahweh alone guided Israel,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>with no foreign god at his side.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In verse 11 there are two words for “wing", the second of which is a poetic word derived from a Hebrew root meaning “mighty".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02700403301000</s>: The reference here to Nebuchadnezzar’s hair growing “as long as an eagle’s feathers” may seem a strange one, since the eagles indigenous to the land of Israel have rather neat-looking heads, and the large vultures have either short bristles on their heads or are bald. The comparison may be to the small Egyptian vulture, which has very untidy long feathers on its head and neck, or perhaps to the Long-crested Eagle <i>Lophaetus occipitalis</i>, which is very common all over eastern and southern Africa, as far north as Ethiopia and Sudan.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In those parts of Africa where the Egyptian vulture or the long-crested eagle are known, the name for either one would fit this context well. Elsewhere an expression such as “his hair grew as long as an eagle’s feathers” is probably the best alternative.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>03300101600022</s>: The reference is probably to the bald lappet-faced vulture.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>While the major English versions interpret the word <i>barbur</i> as meaning “fowl", that is, “domestic chickens", many commentaries suggest that the word means “goose". In Europe, the Middle East, and Egypt the graylag goose was domesticated centuries before the domesticated chicken was introduced from India, and this has led these commentators to suggest that the bird prepared for Solomon’s table was the goose.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>An Egyptian illustration from around 2500 B.C. shows geese being force-fed with grain, a process that fattened the goose quickly and caused it to develop an oversized liver, which was a delicacy. This may have been the method used for fattening Solomon’s geese too.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However, the fact that in Arabic <i>birbir</i> is the name for the domestic chicken has led a few commentators to suggest that the Hebrew <i>barbur</i> is the domestic fowl. Against this is the fact that <i>barbur</i> is derived from a root that means “pure white,” and white strains of domestic fowl were not developed until fairly recently. All ancient chickens were reddish brown.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The <a>JB</a> rendering “cuckoos” can be discounted, as it derives from the fact that a type of cuckoo was considered a delicacy in ancient Rome centuries after the time of Solomon. The other food items on the list of provisions for Solomon are ordinary food items rather than exotic delicacies, and there is no reason to suppose that the barburim were any different.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>One or two commentaries have suggested that barbur was the name for the swan, as is the case in modern Hebrew. However, swans were very rare visitors to Israel, and there is no evidence to suggest that they were domesticated or even well-known in biblical times.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Geese belong to the same bird family as ducks and swans, which all have webbed feet for swimming. Geese are larger than ducks and smaller than swans and spend more time out of the water than either of the others. While ducks and swans eat mainly underwater vegetation, geese graze on the shores.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0275_graylag_goose"/>The Graylag Goose <i>Anser anser</i> is a large gray goose with soft white down on its belly. This down has been collected since ancient times to stuff pillows and mat-tresses. Its beak is not as long nor as flat as a duck’s. It is very vigilant, and when suspecting danger or seeing strangers approaching, it first lifts its beak skywards; then if the danger is confirmed, it begins to utter a series of loud honks. This made the goose a sought-after watchdog to warn householders about the approach of robbers at night. Geese saved Rome by warning the citizens that their enemies, the Gauls, were approaching one night in 390 B.C.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0202_egyptian_geese"/>Besides the graylag goose, the Israelites would also have been very familiar with the Egyptian Goose <i>Alopochen aegypticus</i>, which is light brown with a dark brown back and wings, with a brown patch on its chest, and a brown circle around each of its eyes. They would also have been familiar with the White-fronted Goose <i>Anser albifrons</i>, which is similar to the graylag goose. However, neither of these latter two types of goose is particularly good to eat.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>A word for goose or large duck is appropriate where such birds are known. In sub-Saharan Africa the specific word for the large Spurwing Goose <i>Plectropterus gambensis</i> is the closest equivalent. In North America the Canada goose and in New Guinea and Australia the Pied Goose <i>Anseranas semipalmata</i> would be the local equivalents. Otherwise, a more general expression for big fattened birds can be used. In some languages a phrase literally meaning “meat-birds” has been possible</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Because of the doubt concerning the precise meaning of this word, a general inclusive word like “poultry", or even “fowl” or “chickens", is perfectly admissible.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0211_falcon"/>The expression “all kinds of <i>’ayah</i> “ in <s>00301100001000</s> indicates that the name refers to a similar grouping of birds. In this case the likelihood is that these are larger falcons and hawks, which probably also include the bigger harriers, kestrels, goshawks, and others. In Israel this would constitute over a dozen species, including the Marsh Harrier <i>Circus aeroginosus</i>, the Peregrine Falcon <i>Falco peregrinus</i>, the Lanner Falcon <i>Falco biarmicus</i>, and the Hobby Hawk <i>Falco subbuteo</i>, but it would probably not include the larger, slow flying kites.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0566_kestrel"/>From the position of the word <i>nets</i> in the lists of unclean birds, it seems likely that it was the smallest category of hawk, which probably included sparrow hawks such as the Levant Sparrow Hawk <i>Accipiter brevipes</i> and small falcons such as the Sooty Falcon <i>Falco concolor</i> and the Lesser Kestrel <i>Falco tinnunculus</i>. The reference in <s>01803902600010</s> to its migrating south would confirm this identification, as all of the small hawks mentioned above are migrants.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The types of hawk indicated by <i>’ayah</i> are smaller than the eagles and kites. They typically are fast flying, but they can also hover. They fly fairly low, searching for prey, and when they find it, they swoop upwards as they turn back, then “stoop” very fast, with wings half-folded. Their usual prey is rats, mice, and other birds. Kestrels typically hover directly over their prey and drop straight down. Falcons also chase other birds in flight and strike them with their talons as they overtake them.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The types of small hawk indicated by <i>nets</i> have long narrow wings and are fast flyers. Their prey is mainly small birds and mice, but they also catch flying insects.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Hawks, large and small falcons, and sparrow hawks are widely distributed around the world, and it should not be hard to find a local equivalent. A word for one of the larger local hawks or falcons can be used for <i>’ayah</i>, and a word for one of the smaller falcons or sparrow hawks can be used for <i>nets</i>. Phrases, such as “large falcon” or “large hawk” for <i>’ayah</i> and “small falcon” or “small hawk” for <i>nets</i>, are also acceptable.</Paragraph>

However, since the name is derived from a Hebrew root meaning nose, there are many scholars who feel that the word originally was used for any waterside bird with a prominent beak. This would include not only herons but also ibises, egrets, and perhaps bitterns and spoonbills.</Paragraph>

They stand or walk slowly in shallow water in rivers, dams, ponds, or lakes looking into the water for small fish, which they catch by suddenly darting their heads into the water. They fly with slow wing-beats.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Hoopoe <i>Upupa epops</i> is so named to represent its call, which has been described as <i>hoop-hoop, poop-poop</i>, or similar sounds. Its name is even similar in some African languages, such as Shona <i>mupupu</i> and Tswana <i>pupupu</i>. It is a bird about the size of a large dove, with a ginger colored head and body, and with wings and a tail that have black and white stripes. It has a long slender beak that curves slightly, and a long crest on its head, which it can erect into a fan shape.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The hoopoe has rather floppy wings and rises and falls as it flies. As soon as it lands, it erects its fan-shaped crest briefly. It spends a lot of time walking around on the ground looking for food. It nests in any suitable hole in a tree or in the ground and may raise two or three broods in a season. Unlike most other birds, it does not remove the nestlings’ droppings from the nest, and the nest smells badly as a result. Hoopoes eat insects and their larvae, termites, worms, small frogs, and beetles.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0542_jackdaw"/>There is no consensus among scholars about the bird this word refers to. The word occurs five times, and from the contexts it can be stated with some certainty that</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>a. it is an unclean bird (that is, it is not a seed eater)</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>b. it is associated with the Judean Desert</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>c. it is associated with ruin</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>An additional feature, which has largely been overlooked, is that in four of the five verses the discourse structure indicates that it was paired in the biblical writers’ minds with the raven. This would indicate that this bird is probably a carrion eater or scavenger and possibly black.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>These contexts would rule out the interpretation “pelican". <s>01910200601000</s> could possibly be construed as referring to the great distress a pelican would suffer in the desert. However, this argument is weakened by the fact that it would be almost nonsensical in <s>02303401100006</s> to indicate that Edom will become a place of hot springs and desolation by saying that it will be “a dwelling place of pelicans". The White Pelican <i>Pelecanus onocrotalus</i>, which is the pelican seen most often in the land of Israel, lives in large rivers, lakes, lagoons, and oceans. They are passing migrants in Israel, staying only a few weeks in autumn. They stop briefly in the Huleh and Eilat areas, as they move from the Black Sea, the Danube Delta, and the Caspian Sea to Africa. No place in the whole of the Middle East could be called a “dwelling place of pelicans". To do so would be to indicate that the place has become a wetland or full of suitable lakes well-stocked with fish.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Some sort of owl seems more likely, and most modern English translations follow Driver’s suggestion in this regard. <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> have “horned owl". This is not a species of owl but a much broader classification referring to a family of owls that have prominent ear tufts. <a>NIV</a> and <a>NAB</a> have an even more general term, “desert owl". There is no such family or species of owl, and the phrase simply means an owl found in the desert.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However, another interesting suggestion has been the jackdaw. Besides fitting all of the contexts, it also makes a fitting pairing with the raven in <s>00301101800016</s>; <s>00501401700006</s>; <s>02303401100006</s>; and <s>03600201400020</s>. In the latter two passages the birds mentioned would be the jackdaw, two types of owl, and the raven, making a typical Hebrew correspondence between opening and closing items, and between the two middle items. The structure of the lists of unclean birds in <s>00301101301000-00301101901000</s> and <s>00501401101000-00501401801000</s> is discussed in the section specifically dealing with these lists (see <l target="FAUNA:3.2">3.2 Birds, clean and unclean</l>). In modern Hebrew the jackdaw is called <i>qa’ak</i>, which might be a slightly modified form of the biblical <i>qa’ath</i>. All scholars are agreed that the name relates to the sound the bird makes, and this would certainly be a good representation of the sound made by the jackdaw.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Jackdaw <i>Corvus monedula</i> is a member of the same family as ravens and crows but is smaller. It is black all over. See the illustration at <l target="FAUNA:3.6">3.6 Crow, raven</l>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Jackdaws are found in the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe. A word for a small type of crow would be the best choice in most other places. Even a phrase such as “small crows and big crows” could be used for jackdaws and ravens.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If an owl is accepted as the meaning of <i>qa’ath</i> then a general word for owl is a better choice than any one subspecies of owl. However, care should be taken not to introduce an association with witchcraft, since this was not the case in the original Hebrew.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0567_black_kite"/>There is little doubt that this word refers to the various types of kite found in the Middle East and Egypt, especially the Black Kite <i>Milvus migrans</i>, which is very common in these areas. The Red Kite <i>Milvus milvus</i> is a passing migrant in the land of Israel, seldom stopping over for more than a few days each year.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Kites can be distinguished from hawks, eagles, and other birds mainly by the way they fly. They fly fairly low and slowly, with very obvious use of their tails as rudders. As they make their turns their tails can be seen to twist. This enables them to turn with great precision in small circles, and they often catch flying insects with their short talons.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The black kite has a grayish head, and the rest of it is a fairly uniform dark brown. It has a long triangular tail that looks V-shaped as the kite maneuvers the two outer feathers.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Black kites feed on insects, frogs, lizards, and food scraps from human dwellings, and scavenge dead fish and shellfish along the beaches of oceans, lakes, and rivers. They also pick off small bits of meat from animal carcasses and can often be seen swooping onto roads to pick up mice, birds, and other animals that have been killed by passing vehicles. They often eat in flight, holding the prey in one foot. Most types of kite are very tame and can often be seen in close proximity to houses; they will catch food scraps thrown to them by humans. When there are large concentrations of flying insects or when kites are migrating, they gather in large numbers.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Black kites are found in southeastern Europe, most of Africa, South and Southeast Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea. In some parts of Africa their close relative, the Yellow-billed Kite <i>Milvus migrans parasitus</i>, is more common. Another very similar kite is the Brahminy Kite <i>Haliastur Indus</i>, which is very common indeed in South and Southeast Asia. In other places where hawks are known, the word for hawk can be used in the Isaiah passage, and in the lists of unclean birds an inclusive phrase like “all kinds of hawk” can be used rather than trying to identify each of the species on the list.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0690_osprey"/>There is also considerable doubt about the meaning of the word <i>‘ozniyah</i>. Its meaning is basically derived from its position in the list of unclean birds, and this makes reference to a type of vulture more likely than the osprey. Since the Black Vulture <i>Aegypius monachus</i> is slightly smaller than the lappet-faced vulture but slightly larger than the bearded vulture, this seems to be the most likely candidate. It probably represents a grouping of eagles and buzzards the same size as itself. In modern Hebrew <i>‘ozniyah</i> is the name for the lappet-faced and black vultures. See the primary discussion at <l target="FAUNA:3.8">3.8 Eagle, vulture</l></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Although the translation of <i>shalak</i> as cormorant has a tradition going back to the seventeenth century, there has always been considerable doubt about this translation. For one thing, the root of the Hebrew word <i>shalak</i> means “to throw or hurl", which would indicate that the bird with this name “throws” itself down onto its prey, something cormorants do not do. They swim low in the water and dive underwater to hunt their prey.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This led the late G. R. Driver to suggest the translation “fisher owl” and this has been followed in <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a>. However, there are problems with this suggestion too. The fisher owl, or more correctly, the Brown Fish Owl <i>Scotopelia ceylonensis</i> is not likely to have been well known; its fishing habits would only have been seen by fishermen on moonlit nights, and that very rarely.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In modern Hebrew <i>shalak</i> is the name given to the Osprey <i>Pandion haliaetus</i>, a type of fishing eagle that plunges into the water from a height and catches fish in its claws. Some Israeli scholars have also suggested that it may have been the ancient name for the Smyrna Kingfisher <i>Halcyon smyrnensis</i> or the Gannet <i>Sula bassana</i>, both of which drop down from a height onto their prey, which they catch underwater in their beaks.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Since there is so much doubt about the identification of this bird, the translation “osprey” seems to have as much, if not more, justification than “cormorant". See also <l target="FAUNA:3.4">3.4 Cormorant</l>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Osprey <i>Pandion haliaetus</i> is an eagle-like bird that feeds on fish. It has a white head, chest, and belly, with a dark brown back and wings. It has a dark stripe from the edge of the beak through the eye to the back of the neck and a faint stripe on its chest. In flight it looks mainly white with dark brown wing tips. Faint bands of brown can be seen on the flight feathers and tail.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>It is found on seacoasts and near lakes and large rivers. It spends most of its time perched on posts, logs, or rocks near the water and hunts periodically by flying slowly over the water. When it sees a fish, it hovers briefly, then dives with its wings raised nearly vertically. It often dives right under the water, then surfaces, shakes its wings, and takes off with the fish held in its talons. In Africa it is often robbed of its prey while it is flying by the larger, faster African fish eagle.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The osprey is found almost worldwide, but is not very common in parts of Africa where the conspicuous African Fish Eagle <i>Haliaetus vocifer</i>, with its white head and tail and loud cry, is much better known. In these areas in Africa the name for this better known bird can be used. In languages where there is no word for the osprey, a phrase such as “fishing hawk” or “fishing eagle” can usually be used.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0691_ostrich"/>Both of these words refer to the ostrich, and some scholars believe that they are really the singular and plural forms of the same word, written slightly differently as the result of a spelling mistake by a scribe. In ancient Hebrew writing they are very similar.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>renanim</i> may be related to a verb root that means “to call loudly", a reference to the booming call of the male ostrich.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The Ostrich <i>Struthio camelus</i> is the largest living bird on earth. It cannot fly, because it has underdeveloped wings. It has a long neck and long legs and is about 2 meters (6 feet) tall. The head and neck are almost bald, being covered in short bristles. The male’s body is black with long white feathers on its wings. Its tail is white, gray, or light brown. The females are a uniform grayish brown.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Ostriches feed mainly on seeds, fallen fruit, and shoots and may occasionally eat a lizard or a frog. They also pick up and swallow small pebbles to aid their digestion. They live in small flocks of about twenty, of which four or five are males. They have very unusual nesting habits. The nest is nothing more than a large shallow hollow scraped in the sand. As many as ten females may lay their eggs in the one nest. Only one female and one male will incubate the eggs, however, with the female on the nest in the daytime, and the male taking over later in the afternoon. This is probably because the black male has better camouflage at night. Since ostriches breed at any time of the year, there are often three or four nests occupied by a flock.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>During the day a female that is sitting on the eggs will leave the nest to feed. If any danger threatens, she will also leave the eggs and try to lure the threatening animal or human away from the nest. Since the eggs will keep warm in the hot sand the female may be away from the nest for a long time. Once the chickens are hatched, they follow the female that incubated them for a while, but females with chicks will fight among themselves until all the chicks of the flock are taken over by one dominant female. At any sign of danger, the chicks lie motionless under a bush, while the “mother” will try to lure the danger away.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Male ostriches make a series of deep booming hoots that can be heard great distances and which are often mistaken for the roar of a lion. (<i>Fauna and Flora of the Bible</i> is misleading in the statement that ostriches make a “hoarse complaining cry” at night.)</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Even though there are only two certain references to ostriches in the Bible, both mention the heartless cruelty of this bird. This is probably a reference to the fact that a) most females lay eggs and then show no further interest in them, leaving them to another to incubate, b) the incubating female may leave the nest for long periods, and c) the hatched chicks are left to one female to care for, regardless of which other females laid the eggs or incubated them. Taken as a whole this seems to be contrary to all “natural motherly instincts."</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In savannah Africa where ostriches are well known there will be local words for ostrich. In Australasia the emu and cassowary are close equivalents, but a footnote may be needed, especially in the case of the cassowary, to indicate that the nesting habits of the ostrich are different, and since it lives in open savannah it can run much faster than the cassowary. Elsewhere a borrowing from the dominant language of the area may be necessary.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01803901300004</s>: This verse is difficult to make sense of in Hebrew. The general consensus among commentators is that it means something like “The wings of the ostrich beat rapidly [or, joyfully], but they certainly are not comparable to the wings of a stork.” <a>KJV</a> alone translates <i>renanim</i> as “peacock".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The reference in <s>01803901300004</s> to the ostrich laughing at the horse and rider is a reference to the fact that ostriches can outrun horses. In some cultures this may need an explanatory footnote.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Owls are found worldwide except in the Antarctic and on some islands. They are active at night and are characterized by flat faces and short hooked beaks that they can open very wide. They swallow their prey whole and later regurgitate the undigested parts as small balls. They also have the ability to turn their heads more than 180 degrees.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There are two basic owl families, both of which are found in the land of Israel. One family is the <i>Tytonidae</i>, which are the Barn and Grass Owls. They have heart-shaped whitish faces, usually outlined by a dark line, and small dark eyes. The other family is the <i>Strigidae</i>, the typical owls. This family contains a large variety of species, all of which have large eyes that may vary in color from light brown through orange to yellow. This family includes the eared or horned owls, the fairly rare fishing owls, and owls that vary in size from the midget scops owl (less than 20 centimeters [8 inches]) through to the giant eagle owl (over 70 centimeters [28 inches]).</Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>Eight species of owl are fairly common in the land of Israel. Most are very seldom seen by humans, but they are quite well known by their different and distinct calls. In biblical times the nights would have been much quieter than in most modern places, and the strange night sounds probably would have interested people, causing some speculation about what was making the sound. The different owls would thus probably have had different names even if people had never seen them. In fact it is unlikely that they would have been able to associate most of the calls with the owls that were seen. (Remember, there were no flashlights then.) What follows are the discussion of eight different Hebrew words used in the Bible for owls.

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0193_eagle_owl"/>Some scholars have linked <i>bath ya‘anah</i> with the word <i>ya‘en</i>, which is the ostrich. In view of the contexts in which the word occurs, however, it does not seem that this is a likely interpretation. In the biblical contexts it can be seen that the <i>bath ya‘anah</i> is linked with jackals, deserted ruins, and wailing sounds. It also seems to be reliant on water (compare <s>02304302000016</s>). None of these are contexts into which the ostrich would fit easily. Furthermore, while it is easy to see the reason why certain birds are listed as unclean, from their diet or association with foreign deities, it is not easy to see why ostriches would be included in the list. They are basically vegetarian, like domestic fowls. The only possible reason would be that since they cannot fly, they were considered somehow “unnatural,” as was the bat.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Other scholars have derived the name from an Arabic word meaning “desert,” and still others from an Aramaic word meaning “greedy.” Driver in <i>Hasting’s Dictionary of the Bible</i> suggests that it refers to the eagle owl, and from its position in the list of unclean birds this seems a distinct possibility. (See <l target="FAUNA:3.2">3.2 Birds, clean and unclean</l>.) The “desert-owl” of <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> is not a distinct species but a general word for owls that live away from towns.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Eagle owls are the giants in the owl family. The European Eagle Owl <i>Bubo bubo</i> is the largest owl in the Middle East, standing over 75 centimeters (30 inches) tall. The corresponding owl in the land of Israel is a pale fawn color, spotted, has ear tufts, and is best known by its loud, deep hooting at night. It roosts by day in deep shade in acacia trees, caves, tombs, and ruined buildings. It feeds on small mammals, including hares, baby gazelles, lambs, rats and mice, and large roosting birds, especially wild and domestic ducks. It is sometimes seen when it is roosting during the day, or when disturbed in a cave or old tomb, but it is seldom seen at night, except in modern times when it is sometimes seen on roads late at night.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Eagle owls of one species or another are found in southern and eastern Europe and throughout Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Large owls of a slightly different kind are found in Australasia. The two most common African eagle owls are the Spotted Eagle Owl <i>Bubo africanus</i> and the Giant Eagle Owl <i>Bubo lacteus</i> (known as Verreaux’s eagle owl in East Africa). The Asian Eagle Owl <i>Bubo indicus</i> is found in hilly wooded or forested country away from towns. The largest Australian owl is the Great Scrub Owl <i>Ninox strenua</i>. A word for any of these owls, or a phrase meaning “giant owl", would be a close local equivalent to use in the lists of unclean birds. In other contexts, a phrase such as “large owls” would be sufficient.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0194_eared_owl"/>As with most of the owls, there is no complete agreement among the versions. It would appear at first that “screech owl” has strong support as the translation of <i>yanshuf</i>. However, this is misleading. The next Hebrew name on the list of unclean birds in <s>00301101801000</s> and <s>00501301601000</s> is <i>tinshemeth</i>, which <a>NIV</a> renders “white owl” and <a>NAB</a> “barn owl". In fact both white owl and barn owl are simply alternate names for the screech owl, which these two versions have included earlier in the list. They have thus actually listed the same owl twice. Among Jewish scholars the translation of <i>tinshemet</i> as barn owl has a long history, and in modern Hebrew this is the name of the barn owl. (See further discussion of <i>tinshemet</i> at <l target="FAUNA:3.17.8">3.17.8 Tinshemet</l>). Thus it seems best to translate <i>yanshuf</i> in some other way.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There are two likely candidates. For translators who have translated the word <i>tachmas</i> earlier in the list as “eared owl", <i>yanshuf</i> can be translated as “tawny owl". For those who decided to follow modern Hebrew usage and translate <i>tachmas</i> as “nightjar", it would be good to translate <i>yanshuf</i> as “eared owl", which also follows modern Hebrew usage.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Tawny Owl <i>Strix aluco</i> is a fairly rare bird in Israel, but where it is present, its call is unmistakable. The male calls with a series of hoots “HOO-hoo-hoo, hoo-HOO-hoo", and the female replies with a higher pitched single hoot “HOO". Its eyes are outlined with pale circles, so that it looks as though it is wearing spectacles. As its name indicates, it is a mottled gray-brown color. It prefers wooded areas or orchards and roosts close to the trunk of a tree.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Owls very similar to the tawny owl, which belongs to the same family as Wood Owls <i>Strigidae</i>, are found in many places in the world. In sub-Saharan Africa the Wood Owl <i>Strix woodfordii</i> is very similar to the tawny owl, while in Australasia the Boobook Owl <i>Ninox novaseelandiae</i> is a good equivalent. Elsewhere the word for a medium-sized wood owl, or a phrase meaning “tawny-colored owl” can be used.</Paragraph>

The case for this translation is probably the strongest, even though not conclusive. If we accept this identification, the lists of unclean birds has a rather neat structure with this the smallest of the owls being paired with <i>nets</i>, the smallest of the birds of prey.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Little Owl <i>Athene noctua</i> is, as its name suggests, a small owl, which feeds at night mainly on insects and nestlings. It is about 25 centimeters (10 inches) in length and has a short tail. It does not have ear tufts. It nests in holes in banks or termite hills. It is often seen in the daytime, usually being chased by a group of small birds.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Some commentators associate this word with a female demon referred to in Babylonian legends, hence the renderings of <a>RSV</a>, <a>JB</a>, <a>TEV</a>, and <a>NAB</a>. However, even if this is accepted, it is likely that this demon was also associated with some type of night bird. In many Middle Eastern cultures, demons and monsters have been identified with owls, probably as the result of their strange sounds at night.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In modern Hebrew <i>lilith</i> is the name of the tawny owl. Some Bedouin say that the trilled call of another owl, the Scops Owl <i>Otus scops</i> (one of the most common owls in Israel), is the hooting of a female demon quietly rejoicing that she has found prey. The root of this name is similar to the Hebrew word for “night” but is actually a Babylonian word. It is also similar to the way some modern Palestinians describe the sound of hooting.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The <a>RSV</a> translation “hedgehog” or “porcupine” is highly unlikely, since the other creatures mentioned together in the same passages are all birds. From the contexts of the three verses in which this word occurs, it seems to have been a bird associated with marshland, with the desert, and with ruins. The translations “bittern” and “heron” fit the marshland context, but not the wasteland context associated with Edom. The “bittern” is even less likely in <s>03600201400024</s>, where this bird is said to build its nest on the top of the city’s pillars. Bitterns nest in thick grass or reeds, almost on the ground. (The Hebrew text of this verse, however, is very problematic.) The “bustard” of <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a>, following Driver, fits only the wasteland context of Edom but not the other contexts. Bustards are birds of the semi desert, which nest on the ground.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>More recent suggestions have been that this bird is actually the Spoonbill <i>Platalea leucorodia</i>, called <i>kapan</i> in modern Hebrew (which might be a form of <i>qipod</i>), or that it might be the jackdaw, since in two of the occurrences of the word, the raven is mentioned in the same sentence. The spoonbill would not fit the wasteland contexts, and this suggestion has very little acceptance at present. The jackdaw would fit all contexts, but it is more likely that the word <i>qa’ath</i> refers to this bird.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This leaves us with the possibility of some type of owl, which would fit all contexts and has the support of most commentators. Confident identification of this bird is, however, impossible.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><a>JB</a> ’s “viper” is the result of taking this word to mean “arrowsnake", a type of viper. However, in the Hebrew poetry this word is in parallel with “kite", making it much more likely that this word refers to a bird of prey of some kind. This also rules out the likelihood that “sand partridge” is correct. Some kind of owl certainly fits the context. It seems likely that <i>qipoz</i> and <i>qipod</i> are two forms of the same word.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0807_short-eared_owl"/>From the variety of translations in the English versions it is evident that there is no consensus on the meaning of this word, apart from the fact that it is a bird that is active at night.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If the bird is one of the types of owl, we can assume from its position in the list of unclean birds that it is between the eagle owl and the little owl in size. In other words it would be one of the medium-sized owls.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There are four possible candidates: the Short-eared Owl <i>Asio flammeus</i>, the Long-eared Owl <i>Asio otus</i>, the Barn Owl <i>Tyto alba</i> (also called the screech owl or the white owl), and the Tawny Owl <i>Strix aluco</i> (also called the wood owl). It is not likely that the Israelites would have been familiar with the long-eared owl, which is a silent passing migrant that keeps to forested areas. If they were aware of its existence, they would not have been aware of the difference between the long-eared and the more common short-eared owls; even modern day bird watchers equipped with flashlights and binoculars have a hard time differentiating them. It is likely that if the Israelites had a name for these owls it was one name, not two. This reduces the possible interpretations of <i>tachmas</i> to three, and of these the short-eared owl is the most likely.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The short-eared owl, like many other owls of the <i>Asio</i> family, is a medium-sized brown owl with a paler face and ear tufts that are not very prominent. It makes a strange sound like an animal or a person snoring. It lives in grassland and semi desert regions.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0679_nightjars"/>Nightjars are night-flying birds that feed on flying insects. They have short beaks that they can open very wide. During the day they roost on the ground or on thick branches. They lie very still and are well camouflaged, so they are seldom seen. However, their presence in an area is known from their calls at night. The two most common nightjars in the land of Israel are the Nubian Nightjar <i>Caprimulgus nubicus</i> and the European Nightjar <i>Caprimulgus europaeus</i>. These birds are about 15 centimeters (6 inches) long and are a speckled brown. They are often heard at night, especially in the breeding season. Their call consists of four two-syllable sounds uttered without pause, all on the same note, with the first and last double syllable quieter than the rest, described as <i>tuka-TUKA-TUKA-tuka</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0058_barnowl"/>As mentioned above, the terms barn owl, screech owl, and white owl are alternative names for the same owl. There is a long tradition among both Jewish and Christian scholars of translating <i>tinshemeth</i> as “barn owl” (<a>NAB</a>, also <a>NIV</a> with “white owl"). <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> follow Driver’s suggestion “little owl", but this does not have as wide support among scholars as “barn owl,” which is also the modern Hebrew meaning of <i>tinshemeth</i>. The <a>KJV</a> and <a>RSV</a> renderings of “swan” and “water hen” respectively can be disregarded. Swans are extremely rare in the land of Israel, and “water hen” is too vague a term to be useful.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>tinshemeth</i> actually occurs three times in the Bible. Twice the word probably refers to the barn owl, but the third occurrence is a reference to a type of lizard or chameleon. (See <l target="FAUNA:4.3">4.3 Chameleon</l>.)</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Barn Owl <i>Tyto alba</i> is one of the most widely distributed owls in the world, being common virtually everywhere but the Arctic and Antarctic regions and remote islands. It is a very pale color, light fawn or gray on the wings and back, and almost white on the chest and under the wings. It has small eyes, a large head for its size, and a very striking heart-shaped white facial disk outlined in brown. This facial disk consists of short bristle-like feathers that help the owl to sense very small sounds. Barn owls often roost in barns, deserted houses, caves, and tombs. They utter a variety of strange sounds, varying from the well-known drawn-out trembling screech, to various hissing, chirruping, and snoring sounds. The females are larger and more vocal than the males. These owls live mainly on rats, mice, and other small nocturnal creatures.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0764_rock_partridge"/>Partridges have been hunted and trapped for millennia. In the land of Israel there are three common types of partridge which are still found today: the Rock Partridge <i>Alectoris graeca</i> (also known in the Middle East as the Chukar <i>Alectoris chukar</i>), the Black Francolin <i>Francolinus francolinus</i>, and the Sand Partridge <i>Ammoperdix heyi</i>. In modern Hebrew the sand partridge is still called <i>qore’</i>, but in biblical times all three types of partridge were probably referred to by this name. The name means “the caller", a reference to the ringing crowing of the males, typically while standing on top of a rock.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Partridges were hunted with stones, slings, and throwing sticks, and were also caught in snares. In <s>00902602000048</s> David likens himself to a partridge being hunted. This is a very apt simile, since he had been moving from one refuge to another, just as a partridge flies short distances from cover to cover when being chased. He had also been hiding in the same rocky hills that partridges inhabit near En Gedi.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>07101103000008</s> there is reference to “a decoy partridge in a cage". This refers to a practice still common in many parts of the world. A male partridge is captured and the caged bird is left in an area where it is known there are partridges, or it is taken from the cage and tethered to a bush by its leg. Grain is scattered around and slip noose snares are set. Toward sundown the captive partridge begins to call, and this attracts other partridges, which begin to feed on the grain and are snared. See also <i>The Works of Their Hands</i>, <l target="REALIA:1.4.3">1.4.3 Cage</l></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Partridge eggs were also an important part of the ancient diet, and many Bedouin tribes still collect these eggs regularly. Up until the twentieth century partridges of all three types were abundant throughout Palestine. Today they still exist but in much smaller numbers.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The three partridges mentioned above live in slightly different habitats. The rock partridge, as its name suggests, frequents rocky hill terrain. It is found all over Israel, where it makes good use of the broken terrain to remain hidden. The black francolin prefers denser vegetation in wadis or river valleys. The presence of both these partridges is usually known from their calls rather than from actual sightings of the birds. The sand partridge frequents the Judean Desert and can still be seen coming to drink at pools in wadis along the Dead Sea.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>All three types of partridge, in spite of their different markings and the fact that the sand partridge is smaller than the other two, are typical of the partridge family. They live in small flocks called coveys, lay a great many eggs, and prefer to run when in danger, flying only when necessary. Even when they take flight they fly for only a short distance before dropping back to the ground. They also have the ability to squat absolutely still, almost in a trance. With their natural camouflage this ability usually means that the birds will not be seen even by someone passing very near them.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The rock partridge is about 35 centimeters (14 inches) in length and has striking white cheeks with a black band running from its brow, through its eyes, down its neck, and curving around its breast. It also has striking black and chestnut stripes on its flanks. Its back and wings are gray. The beak and legs are red. Both sexes look alike.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The black francolin is about the same size but has a slightly shorter tail. The male has a black breast and flanks. The female is a speckled brown.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The sand partridge is the color of the local sand and is about half the size of the other two types.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Partridges or their close relatives the button quails and pheasants are found all over the world, and finding a local equivalent should not prove difficult. In Asia the Bamboo Partridge <i>Alectoris orientalis</i> is found from Pakistan to China and down through Southeast Asia. In Australia the Brown Quail <i>Coturnix australis</i> and the Stubble Quail <i>Coturnix pectoralis</i> are probably the closest equivalents, rather than the mallee fowl or the scrub fowl, which are mound builders, a very specialized type of bird.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In Africa any of the francolins are a good equivalent. They are found all over Africa.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02401701100002</s>: There are a number of problems connected with the exegesis of the first half of this verse, as can be seen from the following English versions:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>"Like a partridge that gathers into its nest eggs which it has not laid” (<a>NEB</a>);</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>"As the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not” (<a>KJV</a>);</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>"Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay” (<a>NIV</a>; compare <a>JB</a>, <a>REB</a>, <a>TEV</a>);</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>"Like the partridge that gathers a brood which she did not hatch” (<a>RSV</a>; compare <a>NAB</a>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In trying to arrive at a well-motivated interpretation of this verse, two Hebrew words are crucial: <i>dagar</i> and <i>yalad</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Dagar</i> is a word found only twice in the Bible, here in <s>02401701100002</s> and in <s>02303401501000</s>. Since the word is not a common one, it is only the contexts of these two verses that provide clues to its meaning. It is the Isaiah passage that gives the most contextual clues, but even there, there are some words with very obscure meaning. Most commentaries and translations agree about the first two verbs but about little else in the verse. If we transliterate rather than translate the disputed Hebrew words in , a fairly literal translation of the first half of the verse reads:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There a <i>qipoz</i> will nest, will lay eggs, will break open, and <i>dagrah</i> under her shadow.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>All English versions translate <i>bak‘ah</i> ("break open") as “hatch them", and this leads some to translate <i>dagrah</i> as “gather her brood". However, it should be noted that this interpretation involves a change of implied object from “eggs” to “chicks” or “brood".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If the translation of <i>dagar</i> were done consistently, one would expect that the Jeremiah passage would be translated:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>a) As a partridge cares for/gathers chicks it did not hatch . . . .</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Only <a>RSV</a>, <a>NAB</a>, and <a>NEB</a> in fact do this. In place of this most of the others have:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>b) Like a partridge that sits on eggs ("hatches” in <a>NIV</a>, <a>TEV</a>, and <a>JB</a>) it did not lay . . . .</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Most versions thus translate <i>dagar</i> in two different ways even though the contexts of both passages seem very similar.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>yalad</i> is a much more common word, and in other contexts it means “give birth to” or “bring forth". <s>02401701100002</s> is the only place where this verb is used with a bird. This would seem to indicate two possible translations of the verb in this verse. The first is “lay eggs". This is what leads to interpretation b) above and to the two very different interpretations being given for <i>dagar</i> in what are basically identical contexts. However, the noun form <i>yeled</i>, when used of birds, does not refer to their eggs but to their chicks (compare <s>01803804101000</s>), and this would justify the second possible translation, namely “to hatch chicks".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Interpretation b) is supported by Jewish Midrashic traditions and by most commentaries and Bible dictionaries. These sources usually contain a reference to “a popular but incorrect belief that partridges steal eggs from other birds.” However, in the course of the research for this Handbook, this assumption was found to be very dubious. Many scholars now question its validity. The major problem with the traditional interpretation is that the only supporting evidence for the “popular but erroneous belief” is this one possible translation of <s>02401701100004</s>. The argument is thus circular: <s>02401701100004</s> must be interpreted in the light of a myth; the source for the myth is <s>02401701100010</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In trying to provide some hypothetical basis for the “popular but erroneous belief,” reference is made to the fact that most partridges indigenous to the land lay twelve or more eggs in a clutch, and this might have led to the belief that partridges collect eggs from each other. However, as mentioned above, there is no independent evidence at all for such a belief. Partridges and their eggs were, and are, a regular and important food source, and it is hard to believe that the ancient prophets did not know where the eggs came from.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There are three possible alternative interpretations of <s>02401701101000</s>, none of which corresponds to interpretation b) above.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The first alternative results from an interpretation of <i>dagar</i> as meaning “to sit in a broody state while incubating eggs.” This is the meaning given as a gloss in Abraham Even-Shoshan’s <i>A New Concordance of the Old Testament</i>. <i>Yalad</i> is taken to mean “lay eggs". The verse can then be translated:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>c) “Like a partridge that sits brooding but has not laid eggs ...."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This could then be taken as a reference to the habit partridges have of sitting motionless in the shade, or as one of their means of defence. In situations of danger from eagles or hawks, they make use of their fantastic camouflage and sit absolutely still for long periods in what is almost a state of trance. When sitting like this one can approach to within a few feet of the bird. The point of the simile would be that the man who has become rich by unjust means is like a partridge that only <i>appears</i> to be productive. No commentator that I know of has raised this possible interpretation, probably because it is difficult to relate to the last half of the verse, which is literally “they will leave him half-way through his life."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>02303401501000</s> the last phrase would then be translated as “sits brooding in the shade.” (In response to the suggestion that the Hebrew should be altered to read <i>betseyha</i> “her eggs” instead of <i>betsilah</i> “in/under her shade", it has been pointed out by many scholars that the sequence of verbs which then results is improbable. The existing text yields “makes a nest ... lays ... hatches ... sits brooding her eggs.")</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The second possible alternative interpretation follows the same understanding of <i>dagar</i>, but <i>yalad</i> is taken to mean “hatch chicks":</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>d) “Like a partridge that sits brooding on eggs but does not get to hatch them ...."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This would refer to the fact that a large percentage of the numerous eggs that a partridge lays were, and are, collected by people or stolen by other animals such as jackals and mongooses, birds such as crows, or monitor lizards. It is interesting that Canon Tristram mentions finding a partridge nest containing twenty-eight eggs, and that a particular Bedouin camp he was associated with collected over eight hundred partridge eggs in a single breeding season. The collecting of eggs is mentioned in <s>02301001401000</s>, and it is likely that partridge eggs were the most common and easiest to find.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Rendering d) is the interpretation adopted by <a>KJV</a>. The point of the comparison would then seem to be that getting rich by dishonest means is as futile as a partridge laying eggs that others steal. The inference seems to be that ill-gotten wealth will be taken away, either by the authorities or perhaps by God. This is the interpretation preferred by a growing number of scholars. It relates fairly well to the last half of the verse.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The third possible alternative interpretation is that followed by <a>RSV</a> and <a>NAB</a>. It involves interpreting <i>dagar</i> as “to gather or mother chicks like a hen does", and <i>yalad</i> as “to hatch chicks":</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>e) “Like a partridge that gathers chicks it did not hatch ...."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The reference would then be to the fact that in a flock or covey of rock partridges the hens do not differentiate between their own chicks and the other chicks in the flock. (This is not true of some of the other partridge species). Rock partridge hens can be seen caring for as many as fifty chicks at a time. As the chicks grow, their ties with the hens weaken considerably, and when the expanding flock divides up into smaller flocks the offspring often move away. Thus the imagery in <s>02401701100002</s> is carried by this interpretation right through the whole verse, and the clause “they will leave him halfway through his life” is very pertinent.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02303401501000</s> can then be interpreted consistently as “There the <i>qipoz</i> will make her nest, lay eggs, hatch them, and gather her chicks under her protecting shade.” Of the options e) seems to be the best, suiting the contexts and resulting in a consistent translation of the two occurrences of <i>dagar</i>. However, a footnote explaining the behavior of rock partridge hens seems necessary in order to convey the inference.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>00701501901000</s> the place name En-Haqore [Hakkore] should be taken to mean “Well of the Caller” rather than “Well of the Partridge", since the name commemorates Samson’s calling to God for help.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0738_quails"/>There is total agreement among versions and commentators that this is the Common Quail <i>Coturnix coturnix</i>. This bird existed in Egypt in enormous flocks numbering many millions for centuries, right up to the early part of the twentieth century. It was netted in enormous quantities, dried in the sun, and exported. The Egyptian bird has a rather limited migration route, going across the eastern side of Egypt to the Sinai, then southward into the Sudan. Other quails that migrate from southern Europe to Africa also cross the Sinai. It was during these migrations, when the birds fly only a few feet from the ground, that they were netted.</Paragraph>

The males have a black chest stripe above a chestnut-colored breast patch.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The common quail is found all over Africa, in southern and southeastern Europe, and in the Middle East. It is then found in a discontinuous band across mainland Asia to Japan. Other very similar species, the Harlequin Quail <i>Coturnix delegorguei</i> and the Chinese Quail <i>Coturnix chinensis</i>, are equally common in Africa and Asia respectively. The latter is also found in Australia, where it is called the king quail. In North America the California quail is well known. In other areas where the true quail is not known, a phrase such as small partridge can be used. The reference in <s>00401103100018</s>, literally “two cubits high above the face of the earth", should be interpreted as “they were flying about a meter 3 feet above the ground.” In the following verse, the text should be interpreted as “they spread them out on the ground,” that is, to dry in the sun.</Paragraph>

This is also the meaning in modern Hebrew, while the tern (a relative of the gull) is called <i>shechafit</i> ("little gull").</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>It is likely that in biblical times this word referred to all seabirds with long narrow wings, including gulls, terns, skuas, coursers, shearwaters, and others. There are at least twelve common species of this family of birds found in Israel, along the coastal areas and on Lake Galilee. The most common are the Black-headed Gull <i>Larus ridibundus</i>, the Herring Gull <i>Larus argentatus</i>, the Common Tern <i>Sterna hirundo</i>, and the Little Tern <i>Sterna albifrons</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Seagulls, as their name suggests, are seabirds, living on the coasts of seas and lakes. Some of their relatives, the terns and skimmers, are also found on the great rivers of the world, such as the Amazon, Nile, Zambezi, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Mekong, Murray, and Mississippi. Some are even found on smaller rivers and ponds. Gulls are bigger than terns and have heavier beaks, with some species having a noticeable hook at the tip.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Most of the birds in this family are white with gray or black backs and upper wing surfaces. They have long flexible wings. They feed on fish or plankton, usually settling on the water to feed. Some dive into the water for their food, and many are also shoreline scavengers, eating dead fish, crabs, and shellfish. They typically follow fishing boats to eat scraps or discarded fish.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Since gulls and terns are found worldwide near the sea or any other significant body of water, a local name will not be difficult to find in such areas. Both of the terns mentioned above occur worldwide, migrating from one hemisphere to the other. The black-headed gull is found in Europe and Africa. In drier or mountainous inland parts of the world where neither gulls or terns are known, a phrase such as “seabird” can be used.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0825_sparrow"/>While the Greek word <i>strouthion</i> is certainly the name for the sparrow, the Hebrew <i>tsippor</i> is actually an inclusive word that refers to sparrow-sized birds in general. These small birds, especially sparrows, were caught in nets and traps and were an important part of the diet of poor people.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0826_sparrows"/>There are three types of sparrow that are common in Israel, the House Sparrow <i>Passer domesticus</i>, the Spanish Sparrow <i>Passer hispaniolensis</i>, and the Dead Sea Sparrow <i>Passer moabiticus</i>. All three are small speckled brown birds. Additional small birds that abound around towns and settlements are members of the bunting, finch, and tit families. Sparrows in particular are usually found in fairly large numbers roosting and nesting together. All are seed eaters and live mainly on grass seeds and grain.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Sparrows or sparrow-like small birds are found all over the world. Finding a local word is not usually difficult. The reference to “a lonely bird on the housetop” in <s>01910200701000</s> takes on additional meaning if the sparrow was intended, since it is a bird that is seldom seen alone. It would then indicate the psalmist’s sense of loneliness at being separated from those with whom he belongs.</Paragraph>

There are two species of stork that pass over Israel, where they stay for a few days as they migrate from Europe to Africa and vice versa.

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0077_black_stork"/>Both of these storks are large birds with long legs and long necks. They are heavier than most herons or cranes. The white stork has a white body, black wings, and a red beak and legs. The black stork is a glossy brownish black color with a white belly. It also has a red beak and legs. These storks migrate from central and eastern Europe to East and Central Africa, occasionally reaching Zimbabwe and parts of South Africa in good rainy seasons. Both types spend most of the time on the ground or in shallow water searching for food. The white stork eats mainly locusts, grasshoppers, and other insects, as well as frogs, lizards, and the chicks of ground-nesting birds. The black stork prefers fish and frogs but also eats the same things as the white stork.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>When storks are about to move to another feeding ground, they usually soar around in upward currents of air called thermals, reaching great heights, and then they soar off in the direction they have chosen, conserving their energy by only occasionally beating their wings.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>It is possible that the name <i>chasidah</i> is derived from the word <i>chesed</i>, meaning “kindness” or “faithfulness", perhaps a reference to the fact that they seem to take especially good care of their young when nesting.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Storks of various species are found in most parts of the world, and many of them have migrating habits. There are species of stork that migrate from Europe to India and the Far East, some that migrate from Southeast Asia to Australia, and one, the Abdim’s Stork <i>Ciconia abdimii</i>, which migrates from Ethiopia to Zimbabwe and Botswana, signaling the arrival of the rainy season wherever it goes.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the few areas where storks are not known, a borrowed word or a transliteration can be used, perhaps with a footnote to indicate that this is a big bird that migrates long distances over Israel.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01803901300012</s>: The Hebrew of this verse is difficult to interpret. The reading supported by most commentaries is “The wings of the ostrich beat rapidly or, joyfully, but they certainly are not comparable to the wings of a stork.” Some, however, suggest that <i>chasidah</i> be corrected to read <i>chaserah</i> (which looks very similar in Hebrew), and then the verse would mean “The wings of an ostrich beat quickly, but they lack flight feathers.” Whichever interpretation is reflected in the text, the alternative should be given in a footnote.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0848_swallow"/>Swallows, martins, and swifts are birds that look and behave in very similar fashion, and in many places where they are found, all are popularly known by one name only. This is true in English too, since all three types of bird are usually referred to as “swallows” by people who are not expert bird-watchers. Scientifically, swallows and martins are related, but the swifts are birds of a completely different family.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The fact that most English versions translate all three Hebrew words as “swallow” reflects the usage of the average person. However, it is likely that <i>deror</i> is strictly speaking the swallow and the martin, while <i>sus</i> and <i>sis</i> (differently pronounced forms of the same word) indicate the swift. In modern Hebrew <i>sis</i> is the name for the swift, and <i>deror</i> is the name for the sparrow, not the swallow.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek word <i>chelidōn</i> refers to either swallows or swifts.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Four species of swift, three species of martin, and two species of swallow are common in Israel. The Common Swift <i>Apus apus</i>, the Pallid Swift <i>Apus pallidus</i>, the Alpine Swift <i>Apus melba</i>, and the Little Swift <i>Apus affinis</i> are all migrant birds that spend the whole summer in Israel. This is also true of one type of swallow, the Red-rumped Swallow <i>Hirundo daurica</i>, and the House Martin <i>Delichon urbica</i>. Another species of martin, the Pale Crag Martin <i>Hirundo obsolete</i> is permanently resident there. The remaining species of martin and swallow are passing migrants that stay only a few days, although a few individual birds may stay all summer in Israel while the majority passes on.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0850_swifts"/>Swallows, martins, and swifts are all small birds with long slender wings and short legs. They fly at great speed for long periods on end, twisting and turning, usually in fairly large groups. They catch insects in the air as they fly. The Hebrew name <i>deror</i> is derived from a word meaning “free,” probably a reference to this wonderful ability to fly freely at speed, swooping, diving, and turning, with no need to stop for a rest. The name <i>sus</i> or <i>sis</i> refers to the swishing sound the fast-flying swifts make in the air as they pass.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The common swift makes a noise described in many bird books as a “high-pitched scream", especially in the breeding season, but it also keeps up a noisy twittering almost constantly, especially near the places where it roosts. This is also a common feature of some other types of swift and many types of martin.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The common swift, house martin, European swallow, red-rumped swallow, and pale crag martin all make their nests under overhangs on rock faces, in caves, or in human structures, such as buildings and the underside of bridges. (<s>01908400400012</s> speaks of the <i>deror</i> making its nest in the Temple.) The swifts make their nests out of grass and leaves cemented together with their saliva (it is the nest of a swift that is collected by Chinese people for the famous bird’s nest soup). The swallows and martins make their nests out of small pellets of mud mixed with grass. Both types of nest are bonded to a rock or wall, usually close to an overhanging projection such as a roof.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Swallows and swifts are amazing migrants. Some species migrate from central Africa to the Far East and to parts of southwestern China, others move from northern Russia and Scandinavia to South Africa. One group of swallows is known to have covered more than 12 ,000 kilometers (7,500 miles) in thirty-five days. When gathering for migration, or when stopping briefly on their way, they can often be seen in the hundreds of thousands. In Bangkok in one night, university students counted nearly two million migrating swallows roosting on the telephone and power lines in the city. They were gone the following day.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Swifts, swallows, and martins are found worldwide. If the local language makes a difference between swifts and swallows, then <i>deror</i> should be translated as “swallow” and <i>sus</i> and <i>sis</i> as “swift". In most languages, however, both families of bird are called by the same name, so that only one word will be used to translate the three Hebrew words.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02002600200016</s> makes reference to the fact that swallows can fly the whole day without stopping once.</Paragraph>

Some are small, being only about 15 centimeters (6 inches) long, while others may reach 2 meters (6 feet) in length. They live in a variety of habitats, from desert sand to rocky wadis, thick undergrowth, and river banks, with different species preferring their own type of environment. The snakes of this region include representative species of all of the major snake families except the rattlesnake.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Many of these Middle Eastern snake species are non-poisonous, but the biblical writers, in common with many other peoples around the world, had the traditional belief that all were poisonous. In fact this region has a higher proportion of poisonous species than most other areas of the world. Like many other people too, the Jews and early Christians had a great fear of snakes of all kinds. Thus there is no reference in the Bible to harmless snakes.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>It is unlikely that the biblical writers would have differentiated between many of the individual species. It is more likely that they only made a distinction between the types of snake that were most common. There were, of course, also general words that included all types.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Some scholars claim that the ancient biblical writers believed that when a snake bit someone, the snake’s tongue stung him at the same time, and that it was this sting that poisoned the man. Others, however, believe that while the poison was certainly associated with the snake’s tongue, the verb “sting” was in fact just the Hebrew way of referring to the rather special way a snake bites. This would be supported by the fact that in many languages around the world the word for a snake’s bite is different from the usual word “bite". In these languages the words used are equivalent to “peck", “stab", “burn", “sting", and such like.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In fact, as most readers will know, snake poison is produced not by the tongue but by glands situated between the snake’s mouth and its eyes, and the poison is conveyed through tube-like vessels to the fangs, which are hollow in some species and deeply grooved in others. When the snake bites, muscles force the liquid poison from the glands into the fangs, thus injecting the poison into the victim.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>All snakes are carnivorous, with some small species eating insects and worms, while the rest may eat frogs, mice, birds and bird eggs, lizards, and other snakes. Without exception this food is swallowed whole. The snake is able to dislocate its jaw, making it possible to open the jaw very wide, and the muscles and skin around the neck are flexible enough to allow the prey to pass. However, snakes eat only very seldom, and some larger snakes are known to have gone many months without food. Even those that eat more frequently do so only every three or four days.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>All snakes lay eggs, but in the case of vipers the eggs are kept inside the female until they hatch. There are thus snakes that appear to give birth to live young, as well as those that lay clutches of eggs.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Snake charming has a very long history and was well known in Bible times. The snake usually chosen for this purpose was the Egyptian cobra, which is a large snake with the ability to spread its neck into a flat hood when it adopts the upright threatening posture typical of the cobra family. It also has striking markings on the hood. The charmer uses a flute-like musical instrument that he plays. The snake begins to emerge from a basket or clay pot and is then hypnotized by the charmer, and begins to mimic the charmer’s movements. It was believed that it was the charmer’s magical music that produced this effect. Modern experiments have shown that the cobra is actually deaf but is sensitive to the vibrations produced by the music. However, it is not the music alone which produces the trance, but the swaying motions that the charmer makes with the flute.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The various Hebrew words for snake all contain sounds similar to the puffs and hisses made by snakes. This makes it difficult to associate a name with a particular species. However, with some of the names that occur repeatedly, the contexts help somewhat to make a tentative identification of the type of snake.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>B. Lizards</b></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There are at least forty species and subspecies of lizard found in the land of Israel, and the Hebrew words, rather than differentiating between them all, seem to make distinctions only between the more obvious main groups of species. Most of these names occur only once, in the list of unclean foods in Leviticus, so identification is only very speculative. In spite of this, however, there is some agreement among scholars about the types of lizard mentioned. This is because the Hebrew words are fairly descriptive, and one can identify a type of lizard with the descriptive name in many cases.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Rather than trying to list the different kinds, <a>TEV</a> sums up the whole list in as “lizards". As a last resort translators can use this option, but since the Hebrew list is specific, an attempt should first be made to find specific equivalents in the translation.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Hebrew words <i>zachal</i> and <i>remes</i> literally mean “creeping [things]” or “crawling [things]", which is the Hebrew way of referring to small unclean creatures, reptiles in particular. The Hebrew word <i>sherets</i> literally means “swarming things” and refers to mammals and reptiles that move close to the ground in groups or swarms. In Israel some vipers give birth to live offspring that live near each other until full maturity. They congregate near each other again at mating time. These vipers are included in the term <i>sherets</i>. The Greek word <i>herpeton</i> is also a general word for reptile; it includes snakes and lizards. All of the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin words usually exclude fish, the one possible exception being <s>00100102000014</s>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0123_chameleon"/>This word appears in the list of unclean birds as well as in the list of lizards, and it seems quite clear that an owl and a reptile had the same name. Giving quite different creatures the same name is a common phenomenon in many languages. For instance, in English the word “cob” is used for a male swan as well as for a type of riding horse, and “sable” is the name of a small carnivorous animal as well the name of a large antelope; in Dutch “duiker” is the name of both the cormorant (a bird) and a type of antelope.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew name <i>tinshemeth</i> is derived from a verb that means “to pant or to breathe loudly". This makes it very likely that the reference is to the chameleon. When annoyed, hurt, or in danger, the chameleon turns black, inflates its large lungs, making itself look bigger, and then opens its mouth, puffing and hissing like a snake.

            <Paragraph>The Chameleon <i>Chamaeleo chamaeleon</i> is a very interesting lizard. It lives in vegetation. It is basically green but can change color to match its environment. It can become brown, pale yellow, or gray, and can vary the shade at different points of its body so as to become mottled or to have patches of dark and light color. This gives it good camouflage in vegetation. It is slow moving, often moving only one limb at a time in a series of wavering movements, mimicking the movement of twigs in the breeze. It has opposed claws on each foot, enabling it to hold very tight and to walk along thin twigs.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>It has small scales and many small wart-like lumps on its tough skin. It has a row of pointed scales down its spine. Some species of chameleon have horn-like protrusions on their heads and faces.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The chameleon’s eyes are unique. It has an eyelid that completely covers the eye except for a small hole for the chameleon to see through. The chameleon can move this aperture around with each eyelid working independently of the other, and this enables it to look in two directions at once. It feeds on insects by catching them with its long, sticky, elastic tongue, which it flicks at the prey. The chameleon is also able to use its tail to wrap around twigs and other things to support itself when the wind blows or when climbing at a steep angle. It can hang by this tail from a twig or small branch and often uses this technique to move from a higher branch to a lower one.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0137_cobra"/>There is general agreement among modern scholars that the word <i>pethen</i> refers to the cobra, since the word is closely associated with snake charming, which requires a snake that can raise the front part of its body vertically, something a viper cannot do. The words <i>tsif‘oni</i> and <i>tsefa‘</i> are also probably references to a type of cobra. This can be well supported by the contexts in which the word occurs, in which reference is made to the fact that it lives in holes and lays eggs. These contexts would rule out any of the vipers.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There is some evidence that <i>pethen</i> was the earlier name for the cobra, and <i>tsefa‘</i> and <i>tsif‘oni</i> were later names. Something similar is the case with English, where “cobra” has been in use only for the last one hundred years, and previously “asp” was used.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>"Adder” is used as the name for some of the subspecies of viper and is probably not the best word to translate these three Hebrew words.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Cobras are characterized by their ability to spread the ribs in their neck area, so as to form a broad flat profile called the hood. This makes the snake look much thicker than it really is. Cobras also have short fixed fangs in the front of their mouths. The cobra that is found in the land of Israel is the Desert Cobra or Walter Innes’s snake (<i>Walterinnesia aegyptia</i>), while the cobra found in Egypt is the Egyptian Cobra <i>Naja haje</i>. The cobra is a large snake, reaching 2 meters (6 feet) in length, and about 50 millimeters (2 inches) in diameter. It is dark brown with a yellowish underside. In some areas where it is found it has broad yellowish bands, which give it its alternative English name, banded cobra. When it rears up and spreads its hood, the hood has a yellowish background, but displays a broad dark brown horizontal stripe.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Its bite is very poisonous, and it takes quick effect, acting on the nervous system. The cobra feeds on mice, gerbils, birds, bird’s eggs, lizards, frogs, and other snakes. It hunts by following scent trails, which it senses with its tongue. When within range of its prey, it raises its head slowly vertically, and suddenly strikes at the unsuspecting victim. It lives mainly in grassland and where the vegetation is fairly thick. It takes cover in rat holes, holes in eroded banks, hollow trees, under logs, and among exposed roots. It may lay its eggs in any of these sheltered places. In cold weather it coils itself up to preserve its body heat.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Egyptian cobra is found all over Africa, and a local word should not be difficult to find. In South and Southeast Asia a word for the King Cobra <i>Naja hannah</i> or one of the other cobras would be a good equivalent. In areas where these cobras are symbols of good luck and the presence of a deity, the Hebrew symbolism might need to be explained in a footnote. In other parts of the world, if cobras are unknown, the name of a local long poisonous snake of a type different from vipers and adders is a possible choice.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In passages where snakes are referred to as “stinging", it is not necessary to use a verb meaning literally “to sting". This is just the Hebrew way of referring to the bite of a snake. As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, in many languages the verb used for a snake’s bite is different from the one used to refer to the bite of something else, such as a dog.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02301402900028</s>: This verse is poetic and contains a reference to sticks becoming snakes, and snakes producing even more dangerous ones. A literal translation is “Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod of striking is broken. From the snake root will spring forth a cobra; its fruit will be a flying viper". The expression “snake root” is a play on words and refers to the “root” of the broken stick and to the snake as the “root” or origin of the cobra. The verse can be restated as:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Do not rejoice, all you Philistines,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>That the rod that struck you is broken.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The broken end is a snake.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The snake will produce a cobra,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>It will produce a poisonous flying viper.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>See <l target="FAUNA:4.10">4.10 Viper</l> for note on “flying” viper.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0258_gecko"/>Translations generally agree that <i>’anaqah</i> indicates the gecko. There are many different species of gecko in the land of Israel, ranging from the fairly large Rock Gecko <i>Ptyodactylus hasselquistii</i> to the small Turkish Gecko or Mediterranean Gecko <i>Hemidactylus turcicus</i>, which is only about 10 centimeters (4 inches) long. <i>’Anaqah</i> is probably a general word for all kinds of gecko. The word is related to a verb meaning “to cry out", and it is this that gives the clue to the identification of the name.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Geckos are the only lizards that call. The name “gecko” is borrowed from the Malay word <i>getjok</i>, which mimics the call of one type of gecko. In many languages the names for the different kinds of gecko also mimic their two syllable calls. For instance, in Thai the giant gecko is called <i>tuk-gae</i> and the house gecko <i>ching-chok</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Besides their distinctive calls, all geckos are characterized by the knobs on the end of their toes. These pads are covered in microscopic hairs that catch on any slight roughness of the surface and enable the geckos to walk upside down on ceilings and overhangs.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Geckos feed on ants, moths, beetles, flies, mosquitoes, and other insects. The males often fight, and one may end up with the detached tail of the other in its mouth. This too may be eaten. Some of the larger geckos also eat small lizards and small snakes.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Geckos are found throughout Africa, the Middle East, southeastern Europe, Asia, and the tropical parts of Australia. In these areas it will not be hard to find a local word. In areas where they are not found, a word borrowed from Hebrew or the dominant language of the area can usually be combined with the word for lizard; for example, “anaka lizard” or “gecko lizard".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>While <a>KJV</a> has “spider” for <i>semamith</i> at <s>02003002800002</s>, other translations and commentators are unanimous in interpreting this word as “lizard". It probably is a reference to the house gecko, which is the most common lizard found inside houses. Most modern commentators take the verb to be a passive in this verse, that is, “the lizard, which can be held [or, caught] in the hand."</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0170_dablizard"/>There is a reasonably strong consensus among scholars that <i>leta’ah</i> refers to the lacertid and agama lizards, both of which are common and fairly obvious in Israel. The lacertids are soft-skinned lizards that live in close proximity to roads and houses. One of the more colorful is the Syrian Green Lizard <i>Lacerta trilineata</i>, which lives in orchards and woods. The most common of the agamas is the Rainbow Agama <i>Agama stellio</i>, which is very common around houses and on walls and rocks.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Most scholars agree that <i>tsav</i> is the name for the dab or thorn-tailed lizards of which there are many species in Israel. Two of the most common are the Egyptian Thorn-tailed Lizard <i>Uromastyx aegyptia</i> and the Colored Thorn-tailed Lizard <i>Uromastyx ornata</i>. The name “dab” is an English version of their Arabic name <i>dhubb</i> or <i>dhabb</i>, which is reflected in the Hebrew <i>tsav</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Lacertid lizards (<i>leta’ah</i>) are fairly small, about 15-20 centimeters (6-8 inches) long, and they have a shiny smooth skin. Syrian green lizards have dark green spots on a lighter green background, with a yellow-green belly. They feed on flies, gnats, mosquitoes, and ants.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0014_agama_lizards"/>The rainbow agama is much larger, reaching 50-60 centimeters (20-24 inches) in length. In the breeding season the male develops bright colors, with a blue tail, green body, and bright orange or bright green head, dependent on the subspecies. The females and non-breeding males are a dull gray color. All agamas are characterized by the fact that they bob their heads vigorously by doing “push-ups” with their front legs. They have long, fairly stiff tails, which they raise when they run. They feed on a wide variety of insects and also prey on smaller lizards. In most of the Arab-speaking world they are known as <i>hardoun</i> lizards. Some agamas have the ability to change color to match their surroundings in the same way that chameleons do.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The thorn-tailed lizards (<i>tsav</i>) are relatively large desert lizards with a length of about 65 centimeters (26 inches). They have a fairly thick, squat appearance and have a thick short tail covered with sharp spikes, which are actually cone-shaped scales. They use this tail for defense. They often crawl into holes or cracks in rocks and then block the entrance with their thorny tail. They are vegetarian, eating various succulent desert plants. Even though they are on the list of unclean foods, they are commonly eaten by Arabs and Bedouin, who keep them in cages and fatten them.</Paragraph>

The <a>RSV</a> term “land crocodile” is the same lizard as the “monitor lizard” of <a>NIV</a>. This suggestion has the most support among modern scholars. The Hebrew name is related to a root meaning “strength,” which could well apply to either the Desert Monitor <i>Varanus griseus</i> or the Nile Monitor <i>Varanus niloticus</i>. The latter creature is not found in Israel, but it would have been well-known from Egypt. Both of these giant lizards are related to the iguanas.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If this word means “chameleon", then the reference is probably to the strength of its grip. It has claws that can close around twigs, with three toes on one side opposed to two on the other, giving it a very tenacious grip. However, this interpretation is not as likely as “monitor lizard".</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Skinks are generally thin and streamlined and have smooth shiny skins. There are small and large species, with the smaller types about 10 centimeters (4 inches) long, while the largest desert skinks reach 50 centimeters (20 inches) in length. Skinks have shorter legs than most other types of lizard, and this gives them a rather snake-like appearance. Some species have no legs at all. Species that live in the desert sand move through the sand with a swimming motion. Other species live in houses or among rocks, typically hiding in cracks and under stones or rocks. A few species live in holes and are very fast runners. They eat insects such as flies, moths, ants, and others; they occasionally eat each others’ tails as well.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Most skinks are grey or light brown, and many have longitudinal stripes.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Skinks are found virtually worldwide outside of the Arctic and Antarctic regions, and a local word is often easy to find. In many languages, however, skinks are not differentiated from other lizards, and a phrase such as “smooth lizard” or “thin lizard” may be the best equivalent.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0817_snake"/>The word “serpent” is a fairly archaic English word, once meaning any kind of reptile, but later only used for snakes. It is no longer used in everyday speech to refer to actual snakes but only to mythological ones and representations of them, especially representations on badges, crests, and flags. It is therefore somewhat strange to find “serpent” in modern English translations, where actual snakes are referred to in the original text. In some of these translations, <a>NAB</a> for example, “serpent” is used in the Old Testament and “snake” in the New Testament.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew and Greek words are general terms including all types of snake. In <s>02302700100040</s> some scholars interpret the word <i>nachash</i> as meaning “reptile” or “dragon” rather than “snake". <a>NAB</a> also has this meaning in <s>02404602200008</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the nineteenth century Canon Tristram reported hearing from Arabs that snakes, especially cobras, could be rendered unconscious in a rigid spasm by squeezing certain nerves on the side of their necks. In this state the snake was said to become like a stick. Some ancient pictures seem to illustrate people doing this. Tristram went on to say that he had not observed this phenomenon personally. However, in recent years this technique has been demonstrated on film. It may be of relevance for the accounts in Exodus of people turning rods into snakes and vice versa.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0180_desertrocksnake"/>Snakes are reptiles, that is, they have no internal mechanism to control the temperature of their blood and have to rely on the sun to do this. They have no legs but propel themselves by wriggling or by gliding along by moving their skin in combination with their many ribs, so that their scales hook onto any small irregularities on the surface they are moving on. This means of moving along is not very obvious, and snakes seem to many peoples to move magically or at least mysteriously. This and the fact that many of them have a poisonous bite have caused many peoples, including the ancient biblical peoples, to have a superstitious dread of them.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>To the biblical writers snakes were a symbol of lurking, unexpected danger. The belief that snakes had poisonous tongues led people to associate them with lies, deception, and misleading teaching, as epitomized by the Devil himself, who is portrayed as a deceiving snake in <s>06601200900016</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Furthermore, since the cobra was the symbol of one of the major Egyptian goddesses, snakes also had connotations of heathen religion. To the Egyptians the snake was a symbol of long life. In some contexts in the Bible the snake is a symbol for Egypt.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the New Testament, besides the above, the snake becomes a symbol for cunning wisdom.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Snakes are found all over the world, except in the far Northern and Southern Hemispheres, where the lengthy cold winters are unsuited to their existence. In most languages a general word for snake is not difficult to find. In some languages there are two general words for snake, one for the viper/adder type and the other for longer, slimmer snakes, including cobras, mambas, pythons, and boas. In such cases the latter word is preferable in most general contexts.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The references to “fiery snakes” should probably be interpreted as referring to the effects of the snake’s bite rather than to its appearance; for example, “snakes that can burn people like fire."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02404602200008</s> means “she [Egypt] will hiss like a retreating snake."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02101001100008</s> means “if the snake bites before it is charmed, that [the bite] is all the income the snake charmer gets."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In most contexts the word <i>tanin</i> is translated as “dragon” or “whale” in <a>KJV</a> and <a>RSV</a> and as “sea monster” in the other versions. However, the word is traditionally translated as “serpent” or “snake” in <s>00200700000000</s>, and in <s>00503203300004</s> and <s>01909101300018</s>, where the word occurs in parallel with another word for “snake".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>While <i>tanin</i> probably does refer to a sea monster, it most likely means “snake” in the passages mentioned. It is impossible to identify the actual type of snake referred to, and most scholars take this word to have the same meaning in these particular contexts as the more usual word <i>nachash</i>. In other words it is an alternative word for snakes in general. See also <l target="FAUNA:7.2">7.2 Dragon, sea monster</l>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Another possibility has been suggested by Jewish scholars in their commentaries on Exodus. They note that, while in Moses’ rod is said to turn into a <i>nachash</i> in the desert, along the banks of the Nile (<s>00200700000000</s>) Aaron’s rod turns into a <i>tanin</i>, which they interpret to mean “crocodile". Each miracle would then be appropriate to its setting: a snake in the desert, a crocodile by the river. One scholar also points out that in <s>02602900301000</s> Pharaoh is called “the great crocodile [<i>tanim</i> &lt; <i>tanin</i> ] that lies in the midst of his rivers,” and that the Egyptians used to worship the crocodile. While no translation has adopted this proposal, it should be given serious consideration.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The problematic Hebrew word <i>qipoz</i>, which occurs only in <s>02303401501000</s>, has been associated by some scholars with a snake. The English Revised Version has “arrowsnake", and <a>JB</a> has “viper". Rather strangely, the name “arrowsnake” is associated with <i>qipoz</i> because the word is said to be derived from a verb <i>qafaz</i> (<i>qafats</i>), which means “to leap.” <i>Fauna and Flora of the Bible</i> even has this note: “The arrowsnake is a serpent which is able to coil itself back and dart forward quickly like an arrow, or to leap from a tree.” In fact the arrowsnake <i>Eryx jaculus</i>, more correctly called the javelin sand boa, is so-called, not because it can leap, but because it has a small head that is hard to distinguish from its narrow tail; that is, it is pointed at both ends of its fairly thick body like a javelin. It belongs to the category of snakes called constrictors, which coil around their prey and suffocate them by crushing the breath out of them. It lives in the sand and among rocks, rather than in trees, and is slow-moving. It reaches about 75 centimeters (30 inches) in length. Nevertheless, the context of the verse and the other words used in poetic parallelism to it indicate fairly conclusively that <i>qipoz</i> is better interpreted as a bird. See <l target="FAUNA:3.17.6">3.17.6 Qipoz</l>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0891_viper"/>There are a large number of snake species belonging to the viper family in Israel. From the contexts it is possible in one or two places to identify the particular species, and it is possible that the various Hebrew words actually refer to particular species. However, associating the various words with the corresponding species is largely conjecture, even though based on careful deduction.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The most common vipers in Israel are the Palestinian Viper <i>Vipera palaestina</i>, the Carpet Viper <i>Echis coloratus</i>, the Sand Viper <i>Cerastes vipera</i>, and the Horned Viper <i>Cerastes cerastes</i>. The Palestinian viper is the largest of these vipers and is found in a variety of habitats, from the woods of the north to the desert’s edge. Since this is the most inhabited area, people are bitten by this snake more than any other. The other four vipers mentioned are found in desert areas, but in slightly different habitats. The sand viper and the horned viper live in the sand, while the carpet viper lives in gravelly areas and among rocks. It often camouflages itself among dried leaves.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The desert vipers, when moving in sand, cannot move in the normal way, so they adopt a movement known as “sidewinding". They do this by moving a coil sideways to a position in front of the head, then the snake moves its head and the front part of its body in the air, arching over the sand as far as it can reach before falling back onto the sand. Then it repeats the movement again. This is done at some speed, and the snake moves diagonally across the sand surprisingly quickly, although not as quickly as another snake moving normally. The parallel elongated S-shaped marks it leaves in the sand look as though it has moved in a series of jumps, since they seem not to be connected. It is generally accepted that this motion caused the biblical writers to refer to these snakes as “flying".</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Vipers are different from other snakes mainly in that they give birth to live offspring. The females retain their eggs in a special sac in their bodies, and when the eggs hatch the small snakes emerge from the mother. The larger vipers produce as many as sixty young snakes at a time, while the smaller sand vipers have smaller broods of about twelve to fifteen. This is what John the Baptist refers to by his well-known phrase “brood of vipers".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The vipers have long hinged fangs located in the front of their mouths. These fangs fold back as they close their mouths. When striking, vipers have to open their mouths very wide in order to get these fangs into the required position.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The carpet viper (also known as the saw-scaled viper) was very numerous in biblical Israel, and in most other areas of its range (it is found in a broad continuous band from West Africa to South and Central Asia). It is likely that this was the <i>saraf</i>, a name derived from a finite verb meaning “to burn something,” a reference to the burning effect of its poisonous bite.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This snake occurs in two slightly different forms. The most common type in Israel and the Sinai Peninsula is a reddish brown snake with a pale underside. It has a row of pale blotches arranged side-by-side in pairs all the way down its back. These blotches give it excellent camouflage. It grows to about 80 centimeters (32 inches) in length, and its head is smaller and its body thinner than most typical vipers. It is very easily provoked and quite an aggressive snake. It is mainly active in the daytime, as it can stand higher temperatures than many other snakes. It lives in desert and grassland areas and feeds on jerboas, mice, and mole rats. Its venom, like that of most vipers, is highly poisonous, attacking both the blood vessels and the blood corpuscles, but, like the poison of most other vipers, it is slow-acting.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Carpet vipers move like other snakes on firm surfaces, but in sand they move by side-winding.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The horned viper is one of the two common sand vipers found in Israel and the Sinai Peninsula. As the species name suggests, these vipers live in sand. They have scales arranged so that with small sideways movements they can bury themselves in the sand, with only their eyes and nostrils showing. This is how they lie in wait for their prey, mainly jerboas and other small rodents. When the sand gets too hot for comfort, they bury themselves even deeper, or they move to the shade of a stone.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The horned viper has an unusually elongated scale above each eye, the “horns". It is a light brown mottled color and moves by sidewinding. It has a broad head and grows to a length of about 75 centimeters (30 inches).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The sand viper is similar in habits to the horned viper, but it is slightly smaller, reaching about 35 centimeters (14 inches) in length in Israel. It is a fairly squat looking snake with a thin neck and tail but a thick body. It is a uniform pale sandy color.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Palestinian viper is much larger than the other vipers of the Middle East. It grows to about 1.25 meters (4 feet) in length, and may be 100 millimeters (4 inches) thick. It is a beautifully marked snake, basically a light brown, with a dark brown zigzag stripe with a pale border down the middle of its back. It also has dark brown blotches with pale borders on each side of the zigzag stripe. Its head is striped.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This snake feeds on mice, toads, and frogs and is often found close to human dwellings. It lives under stones or in vegetation. As mentioned above, more people are bitten by this snake than any other. It is likely that this is the snake referred to by the Greek word <i>echidna</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Vipers have the same basic significance in the Bible as other snakes, (see above) with one additional feature. Since the young are carried alive inside the female viper, which then gives birth to large numbers of well-developed young, all at the same time, the viper was associated with fertility. This was also their significance in the Egyptian and Canaanite religious systems.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Although vipers are found widely all over the world, not all languages distinguish them from other types of snake. As mentioned above, the carpet viper is found across Central Africa, from the west to east coasts, and into Central and South Asia. In these areas the name for this snake can be used in all the verses that refer to vipers. In southern Africa the Puff Adder <i>Bitis arietans</i> is probably the best equivalent.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In order to retain the relationship of the word <i>saraf</i> with the verb “to burn something,” translators often try to use expressions such as “vipers that burn [people]” or “fiery serpents". This is only possible where the word used for “burn” means “to cause a wound with something hot.” One should not convey the idea of “a viper that sets people on fire” or “a viper that is burning.” Often it is better to use a phrase meaning simply “poisonous vipers".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00104901700012</s>: Some commentaries have identified this snake as one of the sand vipers, since these conceal themselves so well that the horse may not see the snake and so be bitten on the heel. However, these snakes live in sand and would not be too likely to lie “by the path.” It is more likely to have been the carpet viper with its perfect camouflage.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01802001600012</s>: The phrase “the tongue of a viper” reflects the Hebrew belief that a snake’s poison was produced by its tongue. This belief should be reflected in the translation if possible. The context clearly shows that profit made by evil means is likened to snake venom, so wording such as the following could be considered:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>What he sucks in is cobra’s venom,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>What he gains destroys him like the poisonous tongue of a viper.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02305900500034</s>: This is a difficult verse, and commentators interpret it differently. A literal translation of the Hebrew is:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>They hatch cobras’ eggs, they spin spiders’ webs,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The one who eats their eggs dies,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The one who/which is pressed, a viper is hatched/born.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The problem in interpretation centers around the subject of the first passive clause. Who or what is squashed, squeezed, or pressed? Many commentators take the subject to be the egg, but a few take it to mean the evil people (compare <a>NAB</a>: “if one of them is pressed, it will hatch as a viper"). If the first interpretation is followed, then the poem would read:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>They hatch cobras’ eggs and spin spiders’ web.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Whoever eats their eggs dies,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>And if one of their eggs is squashed a viper breaks out.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However, many have pointed out that it makes little sense to say a viper emerges from a cobra’s egg. The poetry would be making no new point at all. However, if the second interpretation is followed, the poem reads:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>They hatch cobras’ eggs and spin spiders’ webs;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Whoever eats their eggs dies;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>And if one of these people is squeezed, a viper emerges.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In other words, if you share the results of their deeds, you are destroyed, but if you oppose them, you are also in danger. The image in this latter rendering would be someone squashing a pregnant female viper whose eggs are due to be hatched. Living baby vipers would emerge. An ancient Arabic saying says “Crush the mother viper, and be bitten by her seven sons.” It is possible that both the Arabic saying and the Hebrew poem have common roots.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0224_fish_en"/>Fish that had both fins and scales were acceptable food for the people of Israel.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0226_fishes"/>Although fish are mentioned frequently in the Bible, there is no direct reference to fishing in the Old Testament. This is probably due to two main factors: a) the Hebrews as nomadic shepherds probably did not eat fish regularly until their sojourn in Egypt; and b) they were afraid of the sea, and thus probably did not get involved in commercial fishing until late in their history. Nevertheless, in Egypt in particular, fish would have been a regular item of the diet. The Nile River was full of good-eating fish, such as Nile perch, tilapia, and giant catfish, although this latter fish would not have been eaten by the Hebrews as it does not have obvious scales.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However, there is ample reference to the fact that after the Exodus from Egypt the people of Israel did eat fish, and different types of fishnets, fishing spears, and hooks are also referred to. Archeological finds indicate that the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Assyrians bred fish in ponds, and it is possible that the Israelites did the same. Most of the commercial fishing was done by the Philistines and other Phoenician peoples. One of the Philistine goddesses, Atargatis, whose cult began in Syria, was a fish-goddess.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Fishing in Lake Galilee does not seem to have been a Jewish activity until the Maccabean period. Until this period it seems that the Jews fished in rivers and streams and perhaps kept fish in ponds, but they bought dried fish from coastal peoples.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew words <i>dag</i> and <i>dagah</i> are general terms and do not refer to any particular species. Marine fish found in the eastern Mediterranean Sea are not abundant, due to the fact that the sea in this region is poor in nutrients. The only fish likely to be caught in any numbers in nets in this region are sardines and mullet. There are tropical reef fish in those few inshore places where the reefs are shallow, and some line fishing may have been done for these species.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek word <i>ichthus</i> and the Latin <i>piscis</i> are likewise general words for fish. However, <i>ichthudion</i> (literally “little fish") is probably a reference to the Lake or Holy Land Sardine (sometimes called Bleak) <i>Mirogrex terrae sanctae</i>, which is abundant in Lake Galilee and has been fished for centuries. This is a small freshwater sardine similar to the <i>kapenta</i> found in the great lakes of Africa. Tilapia are also abundant in Lake Galilee.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>enalion</i> includes fish in its meaning but refers to all sea creatures, including crustaceans and dolphins. The word <i>opsarion</i> refers to cooked fish or fish about to be cooked and eaten. In the context of <s>04302100500018</s> <i>prosfagion</i> refers to fish for breakfast. The word <i>nēktos</i> literally means “swimmer” and may include other water creatures, such as frogs.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In most contexts a general word for fish can be used. In <s>01804100701000</s> the Hebrew text has “fish spears". These were simple sharpened reeds in contrast to metal-headed war spears.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the case of <i>ichthudion</i> one may use a word for a locally known freshwater sardine or a phrase meaning “small fish". For <i>opsarion</i> “cooked fish” can be used. For <i>prosfagion</i>, which occurs in the question “Have you caught any fish?” the usual word used in such a common question should be used.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek word <i>enalion</i> is best translated as “sea creatures” or “things that live in the sea."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Kētos</i> is not the usual word for fish, and most commentators suggest that it means a sea monster or a monster fish. It is best translated as “monster fish", “sea monster", or “huge fish".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Note: The fish became a Christian symbol in the second century A.D. It was based on the Greek <i>Iēsous CHristos THeou ‘Uios Sōtēr</i>, “Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior.” The first letters of the Greek words spell <i>ICHTHUS</i>, the Greek word for fish.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0247_frog"/>There is little doubt that the Hebrew and Greek words mean “frog". The plague of frogs mentioned in Exodus comes after the plague of polluted water. The frogs seem to have left the water and come into the villages. Since frogs eat flies and thus control fly populations, it seems likely that the death of the frogs was one of the causes of the next two plagues to trouble Egypt, namely gnats and flies.</Paragraph>

They are both about 70 millimeters (3 inches) long and are brown or olive-green in color. They live in the water almost all of the time and eat gnats, flies, and other waterside insects. They lay eggs, which hatch as tadpoles and gradually grow legs. The hind legs are much bigger and better developed than the front legs, since the hind legs are used for jumping.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word refers to something that was used in the mixture of aromatic spices that made frankincense. This ingredient is believed to have been the nail-like covering on the foot of a mollusk (that is, a boneless sea creature) of the <i>strombus</i> type. However, a few scholars suggest that it is a type of flower.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The <i>strombus</i> mollusks are a type of sea creature something like snails, which live inside a single shell, usually spiral in structure. They have eyes set on the end of each of two stalks. Part of the mollusk extends from the shell and attaches itself to a rock or other flat surface. This is called the foot and is the means by which the mollusk moves. The foot has a nail or scale-like covering called the operculum, and when the mollusk withdraws into its shell this operculum acts as a lid, sealing the opening of the shell. It is this operculum that is thought to have been referred to by the Hebrew word <i>shechelet</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The only languages that will have a good equivalent of this Hebrew word are those spoken by people who have an intimate knowledge of sea creatures. Elsewhere it is probably best to opt for the solution followed by the translators of <a>NEB</a> and use an expression such as “aromatic seashell” or “fragrant seashell". Another alternative would be to use a transliteration of the Hebrew <i>shechelet</i> or the Greek <i>onycha</i>, with an entry in a word list indicating what the word refers to.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0816_snail"/>There is a very long tradition interpreting this word as “snail". A few scholars, arguing from the fact that the expression “untimely birth” occurs in the parallel line, have argued that <i>shablul</i> means a miscarriage or an aborted fetus, but only <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> have followed this suggestion.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Snails are mollusks but many types live on land, usually in moist conditions. They normally have spiral shells, which they carry with them as they move. In Israel, where the predominant soil type has been formed from limestone, snails have very strong shells and are able to live even in desert conditions, provided they have somewhere to shelter from the extreme heat. Some species feed on other snails, but most are vegetarian. Part of their body, called the foot, extends out of the shell, and it is this that propels them with a wave-like motion. Their head also extends out of the shell. As the snail moves it excretes a slime along which it travels, leaving behind it a slimy trail. Ancient Israelites seem to have believed that this was evidence that the snail melted as it moved along.</Paragraph>

It collects grain and grass seeds, when these ripen in the summer, and stores them in its nest for the winter.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The harvester ant is a fairly large dark brown ant, and like most ants, its nest is home to a queen ant, to workers, and to soldier ants that protect the nest. The nest is underground with an entrance that is usually well marked both by the tiny trails leading into it and by the amount of chaff dumped near the entrance by the ants. Any ant is capable of carrying many times its own weight.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0067_bees"/>The species of bee found in Israel in biblical times was obviously a fierce strain, since most of the references are to it swarming around and attacking people. In fact it is likely that all bees were originally much fiercer than the fairly docile bees commonly kept in hives today(the result of breeding from selected queen bees. Most biblical references are to “wild bees", that is, bees in natural hives rather than in hives made by man. However, it is likely that bees were also kept in apiaries, since we know that the practice was common in Egypt, Greece, and Rome from very early times.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word for “honey", <i>devash</i>, is also used for syrup extracted from figs, dates, and grapes, or from certain types of palm tree. The phrase “a land flowing with milk and honey” refers to a land that is fertile and thus rich in pasture, fruit, and the grain and flowers from which bees make honey.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0068_beesflower"/>The bee is a flying insect that collects nectar from flowers and converts it into honey. It lives in swarms made up of many thousands of bees. They make a hive in a hollow log, in spaces between rocks, in holes in the ground, in old termite nests, or other places. There the bees build combs made of wax. In the comb are small cells, and in the cells nearest the center of the hive the queen bee lays eggs, and young are raised, while the honey is stored in cells toward the outside. Bees are able to sting and do so when they feel that their hive is threatened. The smell of one bee’s sting makes the other bees in the hive aggressive.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Since bees are universal, translation usually does not present a problem. Where no generic term exists for bees in general, the specific name for a honey bee, or a bee that makes edible honey, should be used at <s>00701400800036</s>, but in all other references the word for a type of bee that swarms around and stings intruders should be used.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Note: The <a>NEB</a> rendering of “They surround me like bees at the honey” is certainly mistaken. It is not bees swarming around honey, but bees swarming to attack, that is in focus.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0236_flea"/>The Common Flea <i>Pulex irritans</i> is one of the fleas that are parasitic on man, but there are other subspecies that also live on dogs, camels, and other mammals. Fleas are very small (about 1.25 millimeters [0.05 inch] long) black jumping insects that suck blood in their adult phase, inflicting itching bites as they do so. Scratching the bites can easily cause infection. Their hind legs are adapted for jumping, and the required tension before a jump is produced by a special sticky protein. The flea strains its leg against the adhesive, and when it snaps free the legs release a surprising amount of energy. A flea less than a millimeter in length can jump well over a meter, that is, more than a thousand times its own length.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Fleas are a troublesome pest, breeding in dirt and dust. The people of biblical times had no defense against fleas, and in houses with mud floors the problem was acute. If fleas got too bad, there was no choice but to move to another house.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Another species of flea (<i>Xonopsylla cheopis</i>) infests the black rat and is the carrier of bubonic plague. See <l target="FAUNA:2.27">2.27 Mouse, rat</l>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The translation of <s>00902401401000</s> should indicate that David is talking in a derogatory way about himself, not about the king. He is referring to himself as “a flea.” In the versions that translate all of David’s words as questions, this is often inadequately conveyed, and the idea is better carried as a question followed by two answers to the question: “What has the king come to find? A dead dog! A flea!” In some languages it may be necessary to say, “I am only a dead dog! I am only a flea!"</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There is a difficult textual problem in <s>00902601401000</s>, and scholars are evenly divided about which is the better text. <a>RSV</a> and <a>JB</a> follow the Septuagint and read “my life", while other versions follow the Masoretic Text and read “flea". It is probably best to translate “flea” with a footnote to indicate that instead of “flea” the Septuagint has “my life".</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The common housefly is a two-winged insect with large composite eyes. It feeds on a large variety of vegetable and protein matter and converges on food, rotting fruit or meat, dung, and household garbage. It is thus capable of carrying germs and viruses from various sources onto human food and may cause diseases related to food contamination.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Flies usually lay eggs on or near one of the sources of food; for example, rotting vegetation or protein such as meat, which is warm as the result of bacterial activity. The eggs hatch as small maggots, which feed on the rotting material. A few species of fly lay their eggs near sores on the skin of humans or animals, and the maggots feed on the flesh of the sores.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Houseflies are found all over the world, and it should not be difficult to find a local equivalent.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The name of the god of Ekron in <s>01200100200048</s>, Baal-zebub, may possibly mean “Lord of the fly", in other words the god who protected people from the sores and diseases caused by flies. However, the name may instead be related to the Ugaritic word <i>zebul</i>, “the highest,” and thus may have originally been Baal-zebul, the Canaanite equivalent of “Most High Lord,” but it was changed sarcastically by the people of Israel to Baal-zebub, “Lord of the fly.” Because of the doubt about the proper derivation of the word, it is probably best to transliterate the name rather than try to translate it, and add a footnote as follows, “This name means ‘Lord of flies’ and may be a mocking corruption of the god’s real name Baal-zebul” (compare <a>JB</a>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>‘arov</i> means literally “mixture” and does not actually indicate a specific insect. For this reason the New Jewish Publication Society Version and the New American Standard Bible (<a>NASB</a>) render “swarms of insects", and <i>Traduction oecuménique</i> de la Bible and the German common language version (<a>GECL</a>) have “vermin". Most English translations have “flies", while some translations prefer a type of fly that stings, “horsefly” or “gadfly” (compare Luther, Dutch common language translation [<a>DUCL</a> ], New Jerusalem Bible [<a>NJB</a> ], and Spanish common language version [<a>SPCL</a> ]. At <s>00200802101000</s> <a>SPCL</a> adds the footnote, “It is not clear which insect the text is referring to. It is probably using a general term to indicate a terrible invasion of all sorts of insects."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Note: In <s>02305100601000</s> <a>NIV</a> and <a>REB</a> have “die like flies", which is a good English idiom, but see <l target="FAUNA:6.6">6.6 Gnat, mosquito, louse</l>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Gadflies, known also as horseflies and blister flies, are various species of biting fly that feed on the blood of any warm-blooded animal or human that happens to be available. Some species are carriers of disease. The particular gadfly referred to in Scripture is probably the Common Horsefly <i>Stomoxys calcitrans</i>, which is very common in the Middle East, western Asia, Australia, and Africa. They are very persistent and will not leave their host unless actually brushed or knocked away. Their bites sting briefly and itch for a short while afterward.</Paragraph>

The root from which it seems to be derived means “to make firm” or “establish", possibly also “to remain firmly attached". The various possibilities reflected in the English versions all have some support.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Four of the five references relate to the plagues that troubled Egypt prior to the Exodus. Some of the insects that have been suggested are discussed below:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0643_mosquito"/><b>Gnat/Mosquito</b>: “Gnat” is a fairly archaic word for a number of species of small flying insects, such as mosquitoes, lake flies, and the minute flies also known as “midges". These all abound naturally in Egypt, especially in the Nile Valley. Thus the pest referred to by the Hebrew <i>ken</i> is likely mosquitoes that bite humans, in this case the Malaria Mosquito <i>Anopheles</i>. This identification was supported by Hort, who pointed out that once the Egyptian frogs had all died, mosquitoes and flies were bound to multiply in unprecedented numbers.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0628_midges"/>Mosquitoes are small flying insects that make a characteristic whining noise as they fly. They are found wherever there is stagnant water and vegetation. Some species are active in the daytime, and others at night. They lay eggs on the surface of pools and puddles or in damp vegetation. The eggs hatch as small worm-like creatures called nymphs, which have hair-like tails through which they breathe. Most species of nymph live in water, but they must rise to the surface to breathe. When they mature, they emerge from the water and wait for their new wings to dry before they fly off to feed. Females of many species feed on human or animal blood, and some species can transmit diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0609_louse"/><b>Louse</b>: This tiny wingless insect belongs to a family with the scientific name <i>Siphunculata (Anoplura)</i>. They are generally tiny, whitish creatures that live on humans, animals, or birds and feed by sucking blood from the skin. The Human Body Louse <i>Pediculus humanus</i> is usually found on the head and hairy parts of the body. Lice crawl around, but they do not jump like fleas. They are extremely common in crowded conditions, because they pass easily from one person to another. They lay small eggs attached to the hairs of the unknowing host.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Lice breed in dirt, and since the water in the first plague had “turned to blood,” the Egyptians probably did not bathe for some time. Conditions were probably dirtier than usual. Lice are also the carriers of the killer disease typhus. However, as a counter argument to the suggestion that <i>ken</i> are lice, some scholars have pointed out that the biblical text indicates that the <i>kinim</i> attacked man and beast, and lice are not normally a serious threat to livestock, but only a nuisance.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The <a>KJV</a> translation “lice” has the support of the eminent zoological archaeologist F.S. Bodenheimer, as well as rabbinical tradition and ancient commentators such as Josephus.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Maggot</b>: The maggots found in many tropical countries are the larvae of various species of fly. The fly lays its eggs in clothing or in wounds on the skin. The eggs quickly hatch out as minute worms that burrow into the surrounding flesh, on which they feed. As they grow larger they form lumps like boils under the skin. The mature larvae then emerge, leaving open sores. These maggots are thus associated with flies on the one hand and with boils on the other. It seems significant that two of the following three plagues in Egypt were in fact flies and boils. This logical possibility is the main support for the <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> rendering. See also <l target="FAUNA:6.13">6.13 Worm, maggot</l>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Ticks</b> are small eight-legged creatures belonging to a class called <i>Arachnida</i>, which also includes spiders and scorpions. However, ticks are much smaller than the other members of the class and do not look like spiders or scorpions. They attach themselves very firmly to the skin of a person, animal, reptile, or bird and begin to suck blood (compare the meaning “attached firmly” which some scholars suggest as the root from which <i>ken</i> is derived). The females become so bloated that they swell to almost one hundred times their original size and then drop off and lay many eggs in the soil. When these eggs hatch, hundreds of baby ticks emerge and settle into the dust or attach themselves to grass stems. They are able to exist like this for many months, just waiting for a suitable person, animal, or bird to pass by. Once they are able to get onto the creature they were waiting for, they crawl around until they sense a blood vessel close to the surface. Then they bite into the skin and begin to feed. The places where they have begun to feed become very itchy and may turn into sores.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Ticks are a common pest in Egypt and many other subtropical and tropical countries. They carry diseases that can be dangerous to man, such as tropical tick fever (also known as relapsing fever), or dangerous to animals, such as Texas cattle fever and distemper. No English translation has yet adopted this interpretation, which is just as plausible as that of the <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a>. However, scholars such as J.G. Wood and G.S. Cansdale have supported this translation.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek word <i>sknips</i> means “louse".</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Mosquitoes, lice, ticks, and maggots are found almost all over the world, apart from some desert regions. The translators should decide upon one of the possibilities for inclusion in the main text of the translation but indicate in a footnote the other possibilities. The footnote could be worded: “The meaning of the Hebrew word is not certain. It may mean . . . , or . . . , or . . . ."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02305100600058</s>: In the middle of this verse the Hebrew text has the following:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Although the heavens may vanish like smoke</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>And the earth become worn out like clothing</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>And its inhabitants vanish like <i>ken,</i>  … .</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Many scholars suggest that instead of <i>ken</i> the Hebrew was originally <i>kinim</i>, and the text should read “vanish like mosquitoes/lice/ticks.” In this context the word would indicate small numerous (perhaps repulsive) insects with a brief life span. Thus <a>NIV</a>, <a>TEV</a>, <a>REB</a>, and <a>NAB</a> have “die like flies"; <a>RSV</a> has “die like gnats"; <a>JB</a> has “die like vermin". Some non-English translations have “die like ants” and “die like fleas".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The reference in <s>04002302400012</s> to “straining out a gnat” relates to a Jewish practice, common in ancient times, of straining wine or water before drinking it. This was to avoid swallowing a mosquito or other insect, which would make the person ritually unclean according to <s>00301100000000</s>. <a>TEV</a> translates the word as “fly", because to English-speaking readers the fly is a dirty insect. However, the emphasis of Jesus’ saying is not on the unclean nature of the insect but on its small, insignificant character. In many languages the translation “mosquito” will suffice, but in some it may be necessary to use “tiny mosquito” to retain the inference.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0304_hornets"/>Hornets and wasps are closely related species, with the hornets being larger than the wasps. Like bees they both belong to the zoological order <i>Hymenoptera</i>, which means that they have stiff, transparent, membrane-like wings. The hornets are usually black or brown; some species have yellow bands. Wasps are often greenish and may also have yellow or light green bands. The larger hornets can be 30-40 millimeters (1-1.5 inches) long.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0899_wasp"/>Both hornets and wasps are characterized by having a long narrow waist between the thorax (chest) and the abdomen (stomach). All have a sting that, because of their large size, can be very painful, even dangerous. Unlike bees, hornets and wasps do not have a detachable sting and can sting repeatedly. They feed on insects, caterpillars, and spiders, and many types sting their prey and then deposit the paralyzed but still living insect or spider near the hornet’s eggs, as a readily available source of food for the larvae when they hatch from the eggs. Some species actually lay their eggs on the paralyzed victim.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0929_oriental_hornet"/>The Oriental hornet <i>Vespa orientalis</i>, typically lives in nests that it digs underground. A nest contains multiple combs in which the colony lives. While nests are most commonly found under ground, some paper nests are constructed in protective hollows such as inside hollow trees. The Oriental hornets have a reddish-brown color and have distinctive thick yellow bands on the abdomen and yellow patches on the head between the eyes. They communicate through sound vibrations and capture other insects such as grasshoppers, flies, honey bees, and vespids with which they feed the colony's brood. They will also collect other animal proteins for their young such as pieces of fresh or spoiled meat and fish. The adults eat carbohydrates such as nectar, honeydew, and fruits. The hornets are a primary pest to honey bees, attacking bee colonies to obtain honey and animal proteins. The sting of an Oriental hornet can be quite painful to humans and some humans are allergic to stings. The Oriental hornet looks similar to the European hornet (<i>Vespa crabro</i>) and should not be confused with the Asian giant hornet (<i>Vespa mandarinia</i>) of East Asia.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Although hornets or wasps are found in most warm countries, some large dangerous-looking hornets are relatively harmless. For instance, the black house hornet found all over Africa does not live in swarms but on its own. It makes mud nests on walls or under a roof. It is large and has a sting, but it is not aggressive and very seldom stings any person or animal. Thus care should be taken by translators to choose the name of a hornet that both lives in swarms and is dangerous. In cases where all local hornets or wasps are relatively harmless, a descriptive phrase meaning “warrior hornet", “war hornet", “army hornet", “death hornet” or something similar can be used.</Paragraph>

Similarly the suggestion that some have made that the word refers to the bloodsucking vampire bat can be discounted. Such bats are only found in Latin America and would have been unknown to the biblical writers. It is much more generally accepted that this word refers to the leech. The root from which the Hebrew word is derived means “to adhere to,” or “to suck".</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Leeches are worm-like creatures of the order <i>Hirudinea</i>. They live in streams, swamps, or damp ground but are also able to live on dry land. The largest of the Middle Eastern leeches is the Nile Leech <i>Limnatis nilotica</i>. Leeches have specialized mouths that enable them to make small cuts in the skin of their victims, which may be humans, animals, reptiles, or even fish. They then fasten firmly on to the surrounding skin and gorge themselves on blood. Their skin has many small folds, and as the leech feeds, it expands until it is many times its original size. When sufficiently gorged it drops off.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If forcibly pulled from the skin, the small cut made by the leech bleeds profusely. Since leeches are sensitive to salt on their skin, they have been removed since very ancient times by putting salt on them. The leeches then detach themselves, and the wound does not bleed nearly as much.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Leeches have been used since ancient times by doctors to cause patients to bleed in a reasonably controlled way.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The locust is the most important insect in the Bible, being mentioned many more times than any other insect. Although there are nine Hebrew words in the Bible which refer to locusts, the most common one is <i>’arbeh</i>. The equivalent in Greek is <i>akris</i>, and in Latin it is <i>locusta</i>. These words certainly refer to the locust rather than to the grasshopper. All locusts and grasshoppers belong to the family <i>Acrididae</i>, which is a family within the order <i>Orthoptera</i>, or “straight-winged” insects. Many species are found in the land of Israel and Egypt, but the most important are the Migratory Locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>, the Desert Locust <i>Schistocerca gregaria</i>, and the Moroccan Locust <i>Dociostaurus moroccanus</i>. All three species are an important local food and are probably all called <i>’arbeh</i> in the Bible.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0274_grasshopper"/><b>Grasshoppers and locusts</b> are both six-legged, winged insects that are characterized by the fact that their third pair of legs is elongated and adapted to hopping. The lower portion of these legs has a row of spikes that are used both for making sounds and as a means of defense. The front wings are narrow, straight, and stiff. When not being used to fly, they function as a cover for thin, membrane-like hind wings, which are much larger and colored, and which are folded together like a Chinese fan. When the locust or grasshopper flies, it hops into the air spreading out its wings as it does so. It flies with a slight clattering sound, made by the stiff front wings striking each other.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Locusts differ from grasshoppers mainly in that they form swarms at certain periods and migrate to new areas, which they colonize. At other times they live either solitary or in small groups. Their reproduction rate varies with the climatic conditions. Eggs are laid in the soil in small packets, and hatching is related to the degree of humidity. In dry periods only a few hatch, but in periods of good rainfall they suddenly hatch out in exceptionally large numbers.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0607_locusts"/>Unlike most other insects, locusts do not go through stages in which they exist as larvae or caterpillars. They emerge from the eggs as nymphs, which are simply tiny wingless locusts with undeveloped hopper legs. The nymphs, which can only crawl around, feed on green vegetation, consuming many times their own body weight each day. As they grow bigger and develop, they shed their skins. Their hopping legs develop before their wings, so that they pass through a stage when they can hop but not fly. At this stage, when they are referred to as “hoppers", they exist in less dense masses than as nymphs, having spread out a little, but since they are now eating even more than before, they can still cause considerable damage to crops. Once they develop into adults they can both hop and fly. If the climatic conditions are right and exceptionally large numbers have developed to this stage, they completely devastate the vegetation where they have been developing. When this happens they begin to congregate in preparation for swarming. In other words they come together and migrate as a group to greener pastures, flying together in large swarms. At this congregating stage, during the migration and immediately after it, they present a major threat to crops and other vegetation, on which they feed unceasingly.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0608_locust_swarm"/>A locust swarm may consist of billions of locusts. G.S. Cansdale quotes a report of a single swarm in 1889 that was estimated to cover 5,500 square kilometers (about 2,000 square miles). Certainly even in recent times swarms have been known large enough to blot out the sun like a large black cloud. The clattering of wings as the locusts approach is a sound hard to forget. Where the swarm lands, even temporarily, every green bush or clump of grass in sight is attacked by the locusts, and the sound of them munching on the leaves is clearly audible, sometimes for hours. Afterwards, hardly a single green leaf or blade of grass can be seen, and many bushes even have the bark eaten off, leaving them bare.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Against such enormous numbers ancient peoples felt absolutely helpless. There was no way they could stop the destruction. The lighting of grass fires helped only in a very small way. Ironically it is when locusts swarm like this that they can be easily caught in large numbers for eating. They are often caught in blankets, fishing nets, and baskets. The lower part of the hopping legs is snapped off, and they are cooked by toasting, grilling, frying, or broiling. In some places they are also eaten raw. When toasted and salted they taste a little like salted peanuts.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Some commentators have pointed out that the plague of locusts in Egypt probably provided the Israelites with food in the Arabian and Sinai deserts, since this is the usual migration route of locusts in that part of the world.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0606_locust"/>Following is a summary of the development cycle of the major locust species: Nymphs, which can only crawl, develop to a hopping stage; the hoppers develop wings and become adult locusts; if climatic conditions are right, these adults gather into swarms and migrate to new locations; the females lay eggs, and the whole cycle is repeated. There are thus four discernible phases: nymphs, hoppers, resident adults, and swarming or migrating adults. It is possible that <i>chasil</i> refers to the crawling nymph, <i>yeleq</i> to the juvenile hopper, <i>’arbeh</i> to the resident adult, and <i>gazam</i> to the swarming adult. However, this is far from proven, as the words seem to be used almost interchangeably when referring to locust plagues.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Crickets and katydids</b>: Crickets are a wingless, nocturnal relative of the locusts and grasshoppers. They are usually black or brown, with shorter rounder bodies, and they shelter during the day under rocks or logs, or, in the case of the so-called mole crickets, in holes that they dig. At night they make characteristic high-pitched chirping sounds, which carry a surprisingly long way. Each species makes a slightly different sound. Like locusts and grasshoppers they feed on vegetation, usually leaves.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0564_katydid"/>Katydids are similar to crickets but are usually green and have wings. They are active at night, when they make cricket-like chirping sounds, but settle during the day underneath leaves in trees. Their wings are leaf-shaped, and with their green color they have excellent camouflage. Some katydids eat other insects.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Both crickets and katydids have extremely long feelers.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Given their large numbers and swarming characteristics, it is small wonder that locusts were a symbol of a vast attacking army against which there was no defense. They were also a symbol of divine punishment.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In two of the five verses that contain the word <i>chagav</i>, the usage is figurative, denoting something small and insignificant (hence the <a>TEV</a> rendering “as tiny as ants” in <s>02304002201000</s>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The usage of <i>chagav</i> in <s>02101200500034</s>, where the Hebrew text literally means “the grasshopper can only crawl” is problematic. Within this poetic section depicting old age, the reference is obviously to one of the signs of human aging. Commentators usually accept one of two possible interpretations: a) that this is a reference to the difficulty with which old people move, or b) that this is a joking reference to the loss of male sexual virility. If the first interpretation is accepted, “grasshopper” is a nickname for a lively person (who now can only move with difficulty), while in the second case the word would be a nickname for the male sexual organ.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The Migratory Locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i> is found in many parts of the world, except North America. In these areas it should be easy to find a local word. However, in some countries with high rainfall this and other species of locust do not swarm in the same way that they do in the Middle East and the drier parts of Africa. In these countries it may be necessary in some contexts to use a phrase such as “swarms of locusts” rather than simply “locusts". In areas where locusts are not known, a phrase like “large/giant grasshopper” can usually be substituted.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew words <i>gev, gov</i> and <i>govay</i> are related to a verb meaning “to swarm” or “to gather together", and thus the reference is almost certainly to the locust.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>tselatsal</i> (<s>00502804200016 H02301800100006</s>) represents the sound of insects’ wings, and the reference is most likely to the sound made by a swarm of locusts. The English versions that have “whirring” or “buzzing” make some attempt at reflecting this, but “buzzing” is inadequate as a description of the sound such a swarm makes. “Clattering", “chirping", “whirring", or “fluttering” comes closest in English to representing the sound represented by the Hebrew word.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> are alone in interpreting this word to refer to the “mole cricket", an insect that at worst creates a minor nuisance, not a plague of the proportions of a locust swarm. In <s>02301800101000</s> both of these versions follow the Septuagint rather than the Masoretic Text, and translate “sailing ships".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Translations that represent a) locust swarms and b) the sound such swarms make are recommended. In English this would be something like “whirring locust swarms” in both the Deuteronomy and Isaiah passages. In many Bantu languages in Africa, and in other languages where ideophones occur which express the sound of thousands of whirring wings, such ideophones are a good equivalent. Elsewhere a noun phrase, modified by an adverbial expression similar to the English, can be used.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In most contexts the word <i>chagav</i> seems to mean “grasshopper", the exception being <s>01400701300026</s>, where the reference is to locusts. In the two passages where the grasshopper symbolizes something small and insignificant (<s>00401303300034</s> and <s>02304002200020</s>), it may not be possible to capture the right inference by translating literally. In such cases the translator is free to use some other insect that is symbolic of small size and insignificance in the local culture, such as “ant", “louse", “flea", and others. In cases where no insect name carries this symbolism, the name of an animal with the correct connotations can be used; for example, “mouse” or “squirrel".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In verses where only one Hebrew word for “locust” occurs, there is little problem, and the word for “grasshopper” or “locust” in the local language can be used. The following notes refer to cases where more than one of these words occur:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00301102200014</s>: This text contains four clean insects. The two Hebrew words <i>sol‘am</i> and <i>chargol</i> occur only here, so it is very difficult to be precise about their meaning. The suggestions, therefore, have to be very tentative.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>From the general rule given in this verse about the characteristics of clean insects, we can deduce that all four of the insects have specialized legs for hopping. This would suggest that locusts (<i>’arbeh</i>), grasshoppers (<i>chagav</i>), and crickets (probably <i>chargol</i>) would be included in the list, as various species of these three insects are commonly eaten in the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia. Since a fourth name occurs in the list, <a>NIV</a> translates <i>sol‘am</i> as “katydid", while <a>NAB</a> translates <i>chargol</i> as “katydids” and <i>sol‘am</i> as “grasshoppers". The katydid is a nocturnal hopping insect similar to a grasshopper in many respects, but usually with green leaf-shaped wings. However, katydids are usually solitary creatures, and not very easy to collect, and thus they are not commonly a food source. <a>RSV</a> and possibly <a>TEV</a> take <i>sol‘am</i> to be a type of locust, so that their lists contain two types of locust, plus grasshoppers and crickets.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> opt rather for four different kinds of locust, which they refer to as the “great locust” (<i>’arbeh</i>), the “long-headed locust” (<i>sol‘am</i>), the “green locust” (<i>chargol</i>), and the “desert locust” (<i>chagav</i>). These identifications are based on the supposed etymology of the words, that is, the ancient Semitic roots from which the Hebrew words are derived. However, etymology is a very dubious basis for ascribing meaning to words, and these particular derivations have little support in the scholarly world. <a>NAB</a> translates <i>chagav</i> as “cricket".</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>All that can be said with certainty about the list of clean insects is that it most probably contains locusts, grasshoppers, and crickets. It is probably safest to translate the list as “all kinds of locusts, all kinds of grasshoppers, and all kinds of crickets,” and add this footnote: “In Hebrew there are four insects in the list. Some scholars suggest that these are four different types of locust."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01100803700024 H01400602800026</s>: The Hebrew in these verses has both <i>’arbeh</i> and <i>chasil</i> in a list of calamities. The reference is probably to adult and juvenile locusts, so translations such as “locusts and grasshoppers", “large and small locusts” and “adult locusts and their children” are common.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01907804600022</s>: In Hebrew this verse again contains both <i>’arbeh</i> and <i>chasil</i>, and the reference is again probably to adult and juvenile locusts. The following can therefore serve as a model:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>He gave their [newly sprouting] fields to the grasshoppers [young locusts/small locusts]</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>And their [mature] crops to the locusts [adult locusts/large locusts].</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01910503400008</s>: This verse contains both <i>’arbeh</i> and <i>yeleq</i> with similar meaning to <s>01907804600022</s>:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>He spoke, and locusts came,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>young locusts/grasshoppers beyond number.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02303300400018</s>: In this verse the two words for locust are <i>chasil</i> and <i>gev</i>, and the reference, as above, seems to be to juvenile and adult locusts:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Their belongings are plundered as if they were being stripped by grasshoppers [young locusts],</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>And people swarm over their goods like (adult) locusts.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02900100400012 H02900202500020</s>: In each of these verses there are no less than four different words for locust: <i>gazam</i>, <i>’arbeh</i>, <i>yeleq</i>, and <i>chasil</i>. Most commentators accept that this refers to locusts in four different stages of development. These would presumably be the swarming adult locust, the resident adult locust, the wingless hopper, and the crawling nymph. However, as can be seen above, although <i>yeleq</i> and <i>chasil</i> are both used for juvenile locusts, it is impossible to say which refers to the nymph and which to the hopper.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The <a>TEV</a> rendering “what one swarm of locusts left, the next swarm devoured” conveys the general idea, but is technically inaccurate in that not all the Hebrew words necessarily refer to swarming locusts. A more precise translation would be:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>What the swarming locusts left, the resident locusts ate;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>What the resident locusts left, the young crawling locusts ate;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>And what the young hopping locusts left, the young crawling locusts ate.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>03400301500034 H03400301600014 H03400301700008</s>: In the Hebrew poetry of this passage three words for locust are used in parallelisms: <i>’arbeh, yeleq</i> and <i>gov</i>. Regardless of the precise meaning of the words for the different types of officials, it is clear that the three words for locust are synonymous. They are a metaphor for a) large numbers, b) destructiveness, and c) transients (temporary visitors). In many languages there will not be more than one word for locust, if that. Therefore, to avoid the excessive repetition of the one word, slightly different phrases can be used. In the following model translation, there has been an attempt to reflect the structure of the poem, while using different phrases for the three words for locust:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><sup>15</sup>Even there the fire will eat you,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>and the sword will cut you down.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>It will eat you as grasshoppers eat a plant.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Multiply</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>like the grasshopper!</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Multiply</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><sup>16</sup>You increased the number of your traders [troops],</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>until there are more than the stars in the sky.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The locust raids then flies away.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><sup>17</sup>Your officers [princes] are like grasshoppers,</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The sun comes out,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>and they fly away.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Where have they all gone?</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>No one knows.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There is general consensus that <i>gazam</i> refers to the adult locust, and <i>yeleq</i> and <i>chasil</i> to juvenile forms. However, a few scholars believe that different species of locusts are involved, rather than locusts at different stages of <a>KJV</a> ’s “palmerworm” and “cankerworm” in are alternative words for “caterpillar", which is almost certainly not a good translation for any of the Hebrew words.</Paragraph>
          </Paragraphs>
          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Some commentators and a few versions have suggested that in the Greek text of <s>04000300400048</s> and <s>04100100600034</s> the word <i>akris</i> could be a wrongly written form of a word meaning “carob pods", a local food (see <i>Fauna and Flora of the Bible</i>, pages 103-104). However, there is no manuscript evidence for such a change. As the text stands it makes perfect sense, since these locusts are eaten and enjoyed as food wherever they occur. Locusts and honey would in fact provide a reasonably good diet, containing protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and trace elements.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0646_moth_larva"/>There is general consensus that <i>‘ash</i> refers to a moth, and <i>sas</i> to its larva stage in the Hebrew Bible, and that <i>sēs</i> in the New Testament also refers to a moth. The moth referred to is always in contexts of destroyed or damaged clothing, so the reference is obviously to a moth that lays its eggs on human clothing. This limits the type of moth to one of the clothes moths of the <i>Tineidae</i> family, probably <i>Tineola biselliella</i>. Although the damage is blamed on the moth in the Bible, it is actually its larvae that cause the damage. It is possible that both moth and larva are meant when <i>‘ash</i> is used.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The scorpion is an eight-legged creature. In the land of Israel it grows to about 13 centimeters (5 inches) long, but in some tropical countries scorpions can be up to 18 centimeters (7 inches) long. The front pair of legs has claws similar to those on a crab, and the tail, which it can arch over its head, carries a fierce sting. It feeds on other insects and on small reptiles, such as baby lizards. It grasps its prey in its claws and stings it with its tail, either killing it or paralyzing it.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The passages in 1Kings and 2Chronicles probably refer to a particularly painful type of whip, hence the <a>NEB</a> use of “lash", <a>JB</a> “loaded scourge", and <a>TEV</a> “bullwhips". A phrase such as “scorpion whip” is used in many non-English translations.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Spiders are eight-legged creatures that typically produce silken strands of web. This material may be used for making net-like webs (in the case of the orb spiders), lining nests, covering eggs, or, in the case of the trap-door spider, for making a hinge for the trap door. The orb spiders, which seem to be the ones referred to in the Bible, spin webs in which they catch their prey, mainly flying insects, such as flies, grasshoppers, and the like. In Israel there are literally scores of different spider species, and <i>‘akavish</i> cannot be associated with any one of them. It is a general word for all spiders.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Spiders are found everywhere throughout the world. However, the spider’s web may not be viewed as something temporary and easily broken in the receptor culture. This is what leads <a>NEB</a> to translate <s>02305900500012</s> as “they weave cobwebs” rather than “they weave the spider’s web,” since the former at least conveys the idea of something undesirable and of no value. In many languages an expression, such as “they weave a weak spider’s web” is a better equivalent. In <s>01800801400012</s> there is a Hebrew word whose meaning is unknown, but the sense is fairly clear:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>What he trusts is fragile;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>What he relies on is a weak spider’s web.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In English, “worm” is a fairly general word, while “grub” refers to worms and insect larvae that eat fruit and some vegetables such as beans. “Maggot” refers to the worm-like larvae flies and beetles, which feed on decaying meat or flesh. The Hebrew words <i>tole‘ah</i> and <i>tola‘ath</i> are fairly general terms for worms of all kinds, regardless of what the worms eat.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers there occurs the phrase <i>tola‘ath shani</i>, literally “worm of scarlet". The Hebrew name indicates both a scarlet color and the dye producing this color. The dye is made from the kermes insect <i>Coccus ilicis</i>, which was found in the Ararat region. The dye was traded by the Phoenicians, who carried it to the Middle East, North Africa, southern Europe, Mesopotamia, and even further.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0612_maggots"/>Unlike the more general words <i>tole‘ah</i> and <i>tola‘ath</i>, <i>rimah</i> and its Greek equivalent <i>skōlēx</i> refer exclusively in the Bible to flesh-eating worms, in other words, maggots. The use of “worm” and “vermin” in modern English versions is motivated by the fact that to say that one’s own body is covered with maggots is repulsive and impolite in English culture. It may not be in other cultures.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Worms, grubs, and maggots are small, soft, legless, tube-shaped creatures that have no bones or shells. They typically feed on overripe fruit, rotting meat, and similar things. Most are actually larvae that hatch from the eggs laid by flies or some beetles. Most of them mature into pupae and then into adult forms of the parent insects.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In the Bible worms and maggots are symbols of uncleanness, decay and insignificance. In <s>01902200601000</s> and <s>02304101400006</s> the word <i>tola‘ath</i> signifies a very insignificant human being or even nation. Where comparing a person with a worm or maggot will not convey the same meaning, it may be possible to find some other insect which symbolizes insignificance. Where no such comparison exists, it will be necessary to follow something like “weak and helpless as a worm” (<a>GECL</a> for <s>02304101400006</s>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Maggots were a symbol of uncleanness, decay, and death. In <s>01802500600008</s> the maggot is symbolic of a repulsive, insignificant person.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Worms and maggots are found universally, and finding equivalents should not be too hard. However, in many languages there are specific words for different kinds of worms or maggots, but no generic word that includes them all. In such cases the individual contexts should guide the translator. When the reference is to worms destroying grapes or olives, a suitable word for such a context should be found; when the reference is to maggots that feed on corpses, a suitable word for these contexts should be used. It is more important to translate appropriately for a given context than it is to translate one Hebrew or Greek word the same way every time.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The use of a word for a flesh-eating worm or maggot is appropriate for all contexts.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>01802402000008</s> the Masoretic Text is very obscure and difficult to understand. It contains a reference to <i>rimah</i>. <a>RSV</a> supports a correction of the Hebrew text, changing <i>rimah</i> “maggot” to <i>shemo</i> “his name". However, many commentators and most modern English versions interpret the verse without making this change and have wording similar to:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The womb [that is, his mother] forgets him,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>And worms feast on him [or, suck him dry].</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Thus are evil men forgotten,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>like broken trees.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Reference is also made to maggots in <s>04100904401000</s>,<s>04100904601000</s>, but these two verses are not in the best Greek texts and are usually included only in footnotes.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>04401202300034</s> there is a Greek verb <i>skōlēkobrōtos</i>, which means “eaten by maggots". The death of Herod Agrippa was seen as punishment for an evil life, and it was believed to result from his being eaten by maggots. The reference may be to sores that did not heal (as may happen with gangrene, diabetes, syphilis, or tropical ulcers) and in unhygienic conditions became infected with maggots, eventually leading to blood poisoning and death. Another possible interpretation is that the “maggots” are intestinal parasites, such as tapeworms or liver flukes, which may cause ill health and eventually death.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In other contexts the Hebrew word <i>behemah</i> refers generally to any large animal and specifically to cattle (see Chapter <l target="FAUNA:1">1 Animals, general</l>), but in <s>01804001500006</s> (where the Hebrew word is plural) the animal is described, and this identifies it as one particular kind of animal. There are basically three possible interpretations:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>a) A mythical monster, symbolic of the forces of evil. Later rabbinical writings make reference to this monster, who is said to engage in a critical fight with another monster, Leviathan. In some of these writings it is said that the meat to be eaten at the Great Feast of Abraham in the last days will be the meat of Behemoth. It was associated with the “great sea monsters” mentioned in <s>00100102101000</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>b) The Hippopotamus <i>Hippopotamus amphibious</i>. This suggestion has been widely accepted and included in various English versions in footnotes. The hippopotamus was certainly well-known in Egypt and possibly in parts of Mesopotamia. However, the description in <s>01804001500006-01804002001000</s> does not fit the hippopotamus at many points:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>For one thing the strength and the powerful muscles of Behemoth mentioned in could hardly be associated with the hippopotamus, which spends most of its time quietly grazing or just resting in the water. (The jaws of a hippo are enormously strong, and bull hippos are dangerous animals, but overall, even a careful observer would not be struck with awe at its muscles and strength.)</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Secondly, the very small stubby tail of the hippopotamus cannot be raised and is only used for scattering dung as the hippo defecates. It could hardly be likened to a cedar as <s>01804001701000</s> says.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0296_hippo"/>And finally, in <s>01804002001000</s> Behemoth is said to be fed by the grass of the mountains, but hippos normally feed on riverbanks, or in the vicinity of flood plains and river valleys, and are rarely, if ever, found in hills, since their extremely short legs and great weight make it difficult for them to step over rocks or climb steep slopes. (<a>JB</a>, <a>NEB</a>, and <a>REB</a> overcome this problem by drastically reinterpreting verse 20, which is not very clear in Hebrew.)</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>c) The elephant. Both the African Elephant <i>Loxodonta Africana</i>, which lived in the Nile valley in southern Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia, and the Indian Elephant <i>Elephas maximus</i>, which lived in northern Mesopotamia, were known in Old Testament times. The description of Behemoth fits the elephant better than the hippopotamus. Its great strength is very evident. When running, elephants also hold their tails out straight. However, the Hebrew word translated as “tail” could also refer to the trunk. The mention of “lying down under the thorn trees, in the cover of the reeds in the marsh” (<s>01804002101000</s>) could refer to the well-known habit elephants have of taking dust baths and wallowing in mudholes and rivers.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>It has sometimes been argued that the references to frequenting rivers and eating grass cannot apply to elephants. But in fact, riverine grasses are a favorite food of elephants, and they often spend hours at a time in rivers and waterholes. See also <l target="FAUNA:2.14">2.14 Elephant</l>.</Paragraph>

          <Heading>Translation:</Heading>
          <SubHeading />
          <LanguageSets />
          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>It is probably best to use an expression like “the monster Behemoth” in the body of the text with a footnote indicating that this possibly refers to the elephant, assuming of course that elephants are known to the readers. If they are unknown it would be better to omit the footnote.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Note: <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> translate <i>behemoth</i> as “crocodile” simply because <s>01804001501000-01804002001000</s> is transposed to follow verse 30 of chapter 39. When this is done, the description in <s>01804002101000-01804102501000</s> then reads as if it is referring to the same animal as <s>01804001500006</s>. Very few scholars would support this transposition, as it requires numerous emendations to the Hebrew text in an effort to make the description fit the crocodile.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0187_dragons"/>The word <i>tannin</i> is traditionally translated as “serpent” or “snake” in <s>00200700101000</s> and also in <s>00503203301000</s> and <s>01909101301000</s>, where the word occurs in parallel with another word for “snake". (See <l target="FAUNA:4.9">4.9 Snake</l>.) Apart from these references and <s>01600201301000</s> and <s>02500400301000</s> (where the word means “jackal"), in all other occurrences <i>tannin</i> is used to refer to a mythical sea monster. It seems likely that <i>tannin</i> is a generic word for all such mythical sea monsters, and that <i>behemoth</i> and <i>livyathan</i> are the names of two specific monsters. In later Rabbinic literature the beliefs about these monsters were expanded and developed, and they were used in apocalyptic writings, where the monsters represent the enemies of Israel.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Another possibility has been suggested by the Jewish scholars Cassuto and Hacham in their commentaries on Exodus. They note that, while in Moses’ rod is said to turn into a <i>nahash</i> in the desert, along the banks of the Nile (<s>00200700000000</s>) Aaron’s rod turns into a <i>tannin</i>, which they interpret to mean “crocodile". Each miracle would then be appropriate to its setting: a snake in the desert, a crocodile by the river. Hacham also points out that in <s>02602900301000</s> Pharaoh is called “the great crocodile [<i>tanim</i> ] that lies in the midst of his rivers,” and that the Egyptians used to worship the crocodile. While no translation has adopted this proposal, it should be given serious consideration. (A picture of a crocodile appears below in <l target="FAUNA:7.3">7.3 Leviathan</l>.)</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek word <i>drakōn</i> is translated as “dragon” in all English versions, except in the <a>NEB</a> translation of <s>07102501600008</s>, where it is translated as “snake". In the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible, <i>drakōn</i> is normally used to translate the Hebrew <i>tannin</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek word <i>kētos</i> refers to any giant creature. In most cases it is used for sea monsters, but in <s>11200307900004</s> <a>NEB</a> translates this word as “whale".</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Jewish thought viewed the sea monster or dragon as a) the embodiment of the chaos that existed in the primary stages of creation, and b) the symbol of the nations that were the enemies of Israel. In the New Testament this second idea is taken up and modified slightly so that the dragon is the symbol of the evil forces that are at war against the church of Jesus Christ.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Most translations use a phrase meaning sea-monster, or a more descriptive phrase, such as “enormous sea animal” or “enormous sea snake". In some cultures, dragons are a symbol of good fortune and prosperity, and in others sea monsters or giant serpents represent benevolent spirits, often associated with rain. In these cultures it is necessary to include footnotes to indicate that the monster of the Scripture passage symbolized the chaos that existed in the early stages of creation (in contexts where this is clearly the case), or that the monster represents the enemies of Israel or the church (in those contexts where this is clearly the case).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the Septuagint <i>kētos</i> is the word used for the “great fish” in <s>03200200000000</s>. See also <l target="FAUNA:5.1">5.1 Fish</l>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02500400301000</s>: This should be read as <i>tanim</i> “jackals” rather than as <i>tannin</i> “sea-monster” (compare <a>RSV</a>, <a>JB</a>, <a>NIV</a>, and <a>HOTTP</a>). <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a>, surprisingly, have “whales” but this is unlikely and has little support from commentators.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0162_crocodile"/>Scholars are divided in the details of the meaning of this word, but all are agreed that it refers to a monster that lives in water. The word seems to be related to a Hebrew root that means “to twist.” Some believe that the notion of <i>livyathan</i> is related to ancient Egyptian beliefs about a mythical monster crocodile that was thought to be responsible for the annual flooding of the Nile and for causing eclipses of the sun. The passages in <s>01804100101000</s> and <s>01907401400008</s> support this view. In <s>01907401301000 H01907401400008</s> <i>livyathan</i> occurs in parallel with another word <i>tannin</i>, which refers to a monster that lives in the water. In <s>02602900301000</s> <i>tanim</i> is described as having powerful jaws and scales. The similarity to a crocodile has been noted by many commentators.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Others relate this monster to Babylonian myths about the chaos dragon Tiamat. The Ugaritic texts refer to a similar monster called <i>lotan</i>, which is the Ugaritic form of <i>livyathan</i>. It seems possible that this is the reference in <s>02302700100038</s>. The probability is that the name is used in both senses in the Bible.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> rendering of this word as “whale” in <s>01804100101000</s> is very radical, especially in the light of the fact that they translate <i>behemoth</i> as crocodile in the previous chapter. There is very little scholarly support for either of these renderings.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There is general agreement among Jewish scholars that <i>tannin</i> is the more generic word for “sea monster", while <i>behemoth</i> and <i>livyathan</i> are the names of two of those monsters. This is reflected in <s>08200604900028 V08200605200002</s>, where <i>leviathan</i> is clearly a proper name for one of these monsters.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Crocodiles are the largest of all reptiles. The species found in the Nile valley is the Nile Crocodile <i>Crocodylus niloticus</i>. In biblical times these crocodiles also lived in the larger rivers of the land of Israel, and another species lived in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Crocodiles look like enormous lizards with large teeth, and they often reach more than 5 meters (16 feet) in length. Their skin is covered in thick fleshy scales. They live in rivers and in river estuaries and come out of the water onto land to sun themselves for long periods each day. When they are in the water they can stay submerged for ten minutes or more.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>They feed on fish that they catch in the water, or lie in wait, wholly or partly submerged until some animal or person comes to drink. They then leap out of the water and seize their prey and throw or drag it into the water where they drown it. They then wedge the prey under a log or between rocks or reeds and tear large pieces from the carcass by seizing the flesh in their teeth and twisting themselves over and over until the flesh comes loose. They then swallow the meat without chewing it. In areas where these crocodiles live, people are killed every year by them.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The monster crocodile of the Egyptians, however, was not a real crocodile but a mythical one of gigantic proportions, which was associated with the annual flooding of the Nile River. It was believed to be so big that whenever it entered the Nile, it caused the river to overflow its banks.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In most translations the word is transliterated from the Hebrew rather than translated, but the name by itself conveys little to the average reader. In languages where crocodiles are well known, the more meaningful expression “the giant crocodile Leviathan” can be used in the Job and Psalms passages. Then, in the Isaiah passage, where the text itself identifies Leviathan as a serpent (or reptile), the name can be used by itself. In some societies, where there are beliefs about mythical monster serpents or crocodiles associated with the flooding of rivers, the local name for the mythical monster can be used, with a footnote to indicate that in Hebrew the monster’s name is livyathan and that it represented the enemies of Israel.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><b>ambiguous</b> describes a word or phrase that in a specific context may have two or more different meanings. For example, “Bill did not leave because John came” can mean either (1) “the coming of John prevented Bill from leaving” or (2) “the coming of John was not the cause of Bill’s leaving.” It is often the case that what is ambiguous in written form is not ambiguous when actually spoken, since features of intonation and slight pauses usually make clear which of two or more meanings is intended. Furthermore, even in written discourse, the entire context normally serves to indicate which meaning is intended by the writer.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>apocalyptic</b> refers to a prophetic revelation concerning the end of the temporal world; for example, the book of Revelation is an apocalyptic writing.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Aramaic</b> is a language that was widely used in Southwest Asia in lands east of the Mediterranean Sea before and during the time of Christ. It is related to <b>Hebrew</b> and in many contexts had replaced Hebrew in use among the Jewish people in the land of Israel at the time of the New Testament.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>archaeological evidence</b> refers to materials from the past that are dug up or that are found and interpreted to explain life in earlier times. This evidence may lend support to written documents or may give us information to help us understand the text.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>borrowing</b> is the process of using a foreign word in another language. For example, “matador” is a Spanish word that has been <b>borrowed</b> by English speakers for “bullfighter."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>chiasmus</b> is a reversal of words or phrases in the second part of an otherwise parallel construction; for example:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A. I</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>B. was shapen</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>C. in iniquity</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>C' in sin</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>B' did my mother conceive</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A' me.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>class</b> is the usual major subdivision of a phylum in the classification of organisms. It usually consists of several <b>orders</b>. See the chart of Animal Classification Ranks on page 2.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>clean</b> and <b>unclean</b> are designations of ritual purity or impurity. <b>clean animals</b> refers to those mentioned in <s>00301100000000</s>, which the Israelites were permitted to eat and to sacrifice to God. <b>unclean animals</b> refers to those animals that were forbidden.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>common language version</b> is one which uses only that portion of the total resources of a language that is understood and accepted by all as good usage. Excluded are features peculiar to a dialect, substandard or vulgar language, and technical or highly literary language not understood by all.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>connotation</b> involves the emotional attitude of a speaker (or writer) to an expression he uses, and the emotional response of the hearers (or readers). Connotations may be good or bad, strong or weak, and they are often described in such terms as “colloquial,” “taboo,” “vulgar,” “old-fashioned,” and “intimate."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>context</b> is that which precedes and/or follows any part of a discourse. For example, the context of a word or phrase in Scripture would be the words and phrases associated with it in the sentence, paragraph, section, and even the entire book in which it occurs. The context of a term often affects its meaning, so that a word does not mean exactly the same thing in one context that it does in another.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>culture (cultural)</b> is the sum total of the beliefs, patterns of behavior, and sets of interpersonal relations of any group of people. A culture is passed on from one generation to another but undergoes development or gradual change.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>descriptive</b> is said of a word or phrase that characterizes or describes another term.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>deuterocanonical books</b> is another term for the apocryphal books (Apocrypha), writings included in the <b>Septuagint</b> and <b>Vulgate</b> but excluded from the Jewish and Protestant books of the Old Testament.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>discourse</b> is the connected and continuous communication of thought by means of language, whether spoken or written.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>domestic</b>, or <b>domesticated</b>, describes animals that have been tamed by and live in close association with human beings, either as house pets or as work animals. Domestication takes place over several generations of breeding, and domesticated animals generally lose the ability to live alone in the wild.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>dominant language</b> refers to the primary language in a region where there may be numerous smaller language groups. The dominant language may be the official language of a country, or it may be an international language understood as a second language by the speakers of the receptor language of a Bible translation. It may also be a <b>trade language</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>dominant male</b> refers to one male that has the right to reproduce with the females of a group in many animal societies. It is sometimes called the “alpha male.” The dominant male’s position is usually attained by fighting and defeating the previous dominant male.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>emendation</b> is a correction or change of a text. It is usually a change made by a scholar through a process of critical editing and not based directly on manuscript evidence.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>envelope</b> is the use of the same or similar words or phrases at the beginning and end of a literary unit. Quite often the occurrence of an envelope is helpful in determining the beginning and end of a section of biblical text.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>etymology</b> is the study of the derivation or history of words. While this can be a helpful study in many ways, it is much more important to know how a word is understood by its users in the actual context of the source language.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>exegesis (exegetical)</b> is the process of determining the meaning of a text (or the result of this process), normally in terms of “who said what to whom under what circumstances and with what intent.” A correct exegesis is indispensable before a passage can be translated correctly.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>family</b> is the usual major subdivision of an <b>order</b> or suborder in the classification of organisms. A family usually consists of several <b>genera</b>. See the chart of Animal Classification Ranks on page 2.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>feral</b> is a technical word used for domestic animals that are living like wild ones, without owners.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>figurative expression</b> involves the use of words in other than their <b>literal</b> or ordinary sense, in order to bring out some aspect of meaning by means of comparison or association; for example, “raindrops dancing on the street” or “his speech was like thunder.” <b>metaphors</b> and <b>similes</b> are figures of speech.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>generic</b> has reference to a general class or kind of objects, events, or abstracts; it is the opposite of “particular.” For example, the term “animal” is generic in relation to “dog,” which is a particular kind of animal. However, “dog” is generic in relation to the more particular term “poodle."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>genus</b> (plural <b>genera</b>) is the usual major subdivision of a <b>family</b> or subfamily in the classification of organisms. A genus usually consists of more than one <b>species</b>. See the chart of Animal Classification Ranks on page 2.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>glossary</b> is a list, usually included at the back of a book, explaining or defining unusual words or expressions used in the text.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Greek</b> is the language in which the New Testament was written. It belongs to the Indo-European family of languages and was the language spoken in Achaia, which is Greece in modern times. By the time of Christ, Greek was used by many of the people living in the eastern part of the Roman empire, so that early Christians could speak and write to one another in Greek, even though they were born in different countries. By that time the entire Hebrew Old Testament had been translated into Greek, a version referred to as the <b>Septuagint</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Hebrew</b> is the language in which the Old Testament was written. It belongs to the <b>Semitic</b> family of languages. By the time of Christ, many Jewish people no longer used Hebrew as their common language.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>ideophone</b> is a vocal expression, often one that does not fit into the usual grammatical pattern of a language, yet expresses such things as an emotion, a quality, or a movement, and may sometimes mark or emphasize a feature of discourse. Ideophones are especially common in African languages, where their use and definition vary greatly.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>idiom</b> is a combination of terms whose meanings cannot be understood by adding up the meanings of the parts. “To hang one’s head,” “to have a green thumb,” and “behind the eightball” are American English idioms. Idioms almost always lose their meaning or convey a wrong meaning when translated literally from one language to another.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>literal</b> means the ordinary or primary meaning of a term or expression, in contrast with a <b>figurative</b> meaning.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>manuscripts</b> are books, documents, or letters written or copied by hand. Thousands of manuscript copies of various Old and New Testament books still exist, but none of the original manuscripts.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Masoretic text</b> is the form of the text of the Hebrew Old Testament established by Hebrew scholars around the eighth and ninth centuries A.D.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>metaphor</b> is likening one object, event, or state to another by speaking of it as if it were the other; for example, “flowers dancing in the breeze” compares the movement of flowers with dancing. Metaphors are the most commonly used figures of speech and are often so subtle that a speaker or writer is not conscious of the fact that he or she is using figurative language. See <b>simile</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Midrash</b> refers to the early Jewish interpretations of biblical texts.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>migration (migrate)</b> refers to the instinctive behavior of some birds and animals that move periodically from one geographical region to another. Migration is usually motivated by the search for food or better climatic conditions.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>modifier</b> is a grammatical term referring to a word or a phrase that is used to modify or affect the meaning of another part of the sentence, such as an adjective modifying a noun or an adverb modifying a verb.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>onomatopoeic</b> refers to the use or invention of words that imitate the sounds of what they refer to; for example, “swishing,” “bang!” or “bubble."</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>order</b> is the usual major subdivision of a <b>class</b> or subclass in the classification of organisms. An order consists of several <b>families</b>. See the chart of Animal Classification Ranks on page 2.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>parallel (parallelism)</b> generally refers to some similarity in the content and/or form of two parts of a construction; for example, “The man was blind; he could not see.” The structures that correspond to each other in the two statements are said to be parallel.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>receptor</b> is the person(s) receiving a message. The receptor language is the language into which a translation is made. For example, in a translation from Hebrew into German, Hebrew is the source language and German is the receptor language.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>render</b> means to translate or express in a language different from the original. <b>rendering</b> is the manner in which a specific passage is translated from one language to another.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>restructure</b> is to separate and rearrange the various components of a sentence or other unit of discourse in the translation process.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Semitic</b> refers to a family of languages that includes <b>Hebrew</b>, <b>Aramaic</b>, and Arabic. <b>Greek</b> belongs to quite another language family, with a distinct cultural background. In view of the Jewish ancestry and training of the writers of the New Testament, it is not surprising that many Semitic idioms and thought patterns (called Semitisms or Hebraisms) appear in the Greek writings of the New Testament.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Septuagint</b> is a translation of the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek, begun some two hundred years before Christ. It is often abbreviated as <a>LXX</a>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>simile</b> (pronounced SIM-i-lee) is a figure of speech that describes one event or object by comparing it to another, using “like,” “as,” or some other word to mark or signal the comparison; for example, “She runs like a deer” and “He is as straight as an arrow.” Similes are less subtle than <b>metaphors</b> in that metaphors do not mark the comparison with words such as “like” or “as.” See <b>metaphor</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>species</b> is the major subdivision of a <b>genus</b> or subgenus, and is regarded as the basic category of biological classification. A species is composed of related individuals that resemble one another, and are able to breed among themselves, but are not able to breed with members of another species. See the chart of Animal Classification Ranks on page 2.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>subfamily</b> is a category of related <b>genera</b> within a <b>family</b>. See the chart of Animal Classification Ranks on page 2.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>subspecies</b> is a subdivision of a <b>species</b>, especially a geographical or ecological subdivision. See the chart of Animal Classification Ranks on page 2.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>symbol</b> is a form, whether linguistic or nonlinguistic, which is arbitrarily and conventionally associated with a particular meaning. For example, the word “cross” is a linguistic symbol, referring to a particular object. Similarly, within the Christian tradition, the cross as an object is a symbol for the death of Jesus.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>synonyms</b> are words that are different in form but similar in meaning, such as “boy” and “lad.” Expressions that have essentially the same meaning are said to be <b>synonymous</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Syriac</b> is the name of a <b>Semitic</b> language, a part of the <b>Aramaic</b> family, used in Western Asia, into which the Bible was translated at a very early date (the <b>Syriac version</b>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Targum</b> is an Aramaic translation or paraphrase of a section of the ancient Hebrew Scriptures.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>trade language</b> refers to a language used as a means of communication when conducting trade and business between peoples of different languages.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>transliteration</b> is the representation in the receptor language of the approximate sounds or letters of words occurring in the source language, rather than translating their meaning; for example, “Amen” from the Hebrew, or the title “Christ” from the Greek.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>vernacular</b> refers to the ordinary language used in daily speech by any group of people; it is in contrast with a learned or literary language.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>versions</b> are translations. The ancient, or early, versions are translations of the Bible, or of portions of the Bible, made in early times; for example, the Greek Septuagint, the ancient Syriac, or the Ethiopic versions.</Paragraph>
          </Paragraphs>
          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><b>Vulgate</b> is the Latin version of the Bible translated and/or edited originally by Saint Jerome near the end of the fourth century A.D. It has been traditionally the official version of the Roman Catholic Church.</Paragraph>
