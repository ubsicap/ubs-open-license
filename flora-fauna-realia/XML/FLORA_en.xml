          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The dilemma of the Bible translator is that the Bible is both a historical document and a literary document. That duality finds its way into every verse of every chapter of the Bible. The historicity of the text pulls the translator toward formal (word-for-word, sentence-for-sentence) translation. The literary, rhetorical nature of the text pulls the translator toward literary, rhetorical, and poetic equivalence, that is, toward making the same emotive impact on the reader that the original did. That usually requires considerable restructuring and transformation. There is no “happy medium,” only various unhappy ones, or rather, unhappy readers on one side or the other!</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Words for trees and plants in the Bible do not escape this dilemma. The first question that a translator must ask is this: Is the immediate context of this word primarily RHETORICAL or primarily NON-RHETORICAL. We say “primarily” here because some texts are difficult to categorize. We say “non-rhetorical” to avoid the word “historical” that carries with it problems of determining what “history” is in the context of ancient texts.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>One element of a translator’s task is dealing with technical terms, and particularly whether they should be translated in a way that makes the item familiar to the reader (“domestication”), or leaves the item a bit strange (“foreignization”). A typical example is in measurements. A Bible translator who converts Jewish “cubits” to feet and inches (or to metric units) “domesticates” the text by using measurements that are familiar to the reader, while a translator who leaves “cubits” in the text is (in many cases) “foreignizing” the text. A translator who uses “figi” (from English “fig”) in the text (rather than a local word) is “foreignizing.” The “foreignness” of the whole translation is determined by the accumulation of decisions to domesticate or foreignize measurements, vocabulary, and even grammar, throughout the translation.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The “dynamic/functional equivalence” Bible translation movement in the middle of the twentieth century brought a new thinking, namely, “God speaks your language.” Radical domestication became the norm. But Bible translation theory changes, and right now “foreignization” is not as bad as we used to think. Too much domestication is seen as misleading or even as patronizing, like “baby-talk.” But how much domestication is the right amount? It depends on what the “stakeholders” want. And who are the stakeholders? The publisher, of course, but more important in the long run are the potential readers.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Let us refine the question: How narrow should a translator’s target audience be? Which group of people should be taken as the model for the Bible spellings: rural people with little exposure to other languages? Or cosmopolitan people whose experiences (including radio and television) have been expanded to include a wider range of concepts?</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Each magazine or book aims at an audience, who in a sense become the “authority” behind that magazine or book. Bibles are the same. Most European and English Bibles aim at people who are able to handle the “foreignness” of the original Greek and Hebrew technical vocabulary. In this Handbook we try to leave some flexibility in our suggestions for a variety of approaches from foreignizing to domesticating, and for translators in a variety of situations and with a variety of audiences in mind.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>To be practical, however, we deliberately attempt to be PRESCRIPTIVE, onerous as that may be to some students of translation. We aim mostly at translators who are doing “dynamic/functional equivalence” translation, with a slant toward taking rhetoric and genre seriously.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Publishers have “style sheets,” recognizing that their set of rules for spelling, format, and style will bring a certain consistency to their many publications, and recognizing also that their set of rules is not universal. Likewise, we promote a consistent approach, and we make no claim that our suggestions for translating Bible terminology are binding on anyone. We can only say that IF a translator follows these suggestions, the result will be within the mainstream of scholarly Bible translation opinion at the beginning of the twenty-first century.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>With each entry appears a list of transliterated Hebrew/Aramaic, Greek, or Latin words that represent the plant being discussed. Following each word are listed references to biblical books. In most cases this reference list contains all of the verses where that particular word carries the meaning being discussed. In instances where a word appears more than about twenty or thirty times, the list only includes the first few places the word is used in the Bible followed by the + symbol indicating that there are more references.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The versification system used in most English translations has been taken as the basis for references listed or mentioned in discussion. This system occasionally differs from that found in the Hebrew Old Testament, the Septuagint, and some non-English translations. When that happens, the alternative versification is placed in parentheses.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew lexicon of Brown, Driver and Briggs is the basis for the transliteration of Hebrew words. We transliterate the Hebrew roots they give, not the specific forms that occur in the text. In a few places some authorities may disagree with the root given.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The United Bible Societies cooperate in translation projects with all churches, where possible. The majority of Christians in the world belong to churches that recognize as Holy Scripture those writings known by some as the Deuterocanon and by others as the Apocrypha. These books (their number differs between Catholic and Orthodox churches) have been included in the listings and discussions of this Handbook. In some cases they introduce plants that are not mentioned in the sixty-six books of the Protocanon. Where a Greek word appears both in the New Testament and the Deuterocanon, the New Testament references are given first, followed by the deuterocanonical references in square brackets.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="FFR_map_en"/>The Hebrew word <i>ya‘ar</i> (“forest”) occurs about sixty times in the Old Testament (including the Deuterocanon), indicating that trees in Ancient Israel were abundant in ancient times. Botanists distinguish “forest” (dense growth) and “woodland” (less dense growth). Hepper states that Lebanon probably had real forests, whereas the Holy Land would have had “woodland” or “open forest,” except for the dense stands of tamarisk and poplar described in Jeremiah as “the jungle of the Jordan.” Large oak woodland once covered the Sharon Plain, while in the mountains fir, pine, cypress, and Grecian juniper grew plentifully. Other trees and shrubs of the upland woods were the cedar, cypress, fir, ivy, laurel, laurustinus, myrtle, oak, pine, and thyine. Some thrived near streams, namely, the plane, oleander, poplar, elm, and willow.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Trees have engaged in a tug-of-war with various forces throughout the centuries. Natural fires have taken their toll, but the biggest enemy has been human. People have systematically cut down forests for firewood, for timber, and for the production of lime and charcoal, right up to the early twentieth century, when the Turks finished off the oaks by burning them as fuel in their trains and by putting a tax on trees, thereby causing people to cut theirs down to avoid the tax!</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The trees have occasionally fought back. In the Sharon Plain, after the original Kermes oaks were cut down during the Arab period (800–1400 A.D.), Tabor oaks replaced them. The remains of a wine press or an oil press now standing in the middle of a forest tell us that now and then Nature wins a battle. But the forests and woodlands are losing the war to cultivation and animal husbandry. Sheep and goats are quite effective in preventing the regeneration of trees. Ever-increasing human populations demand more and more cropland. Chemical fertilizers make it impossible for the long process of regeneration even to begin. It is only thanks to the creation of nature preserves here and there that we know what the forests and woodlands of the Holy Land may have looked like centuries ago.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Occurring almost five times as frequently as <i>ya‘ar</i> (“forest”), the Hebrew word <i>midbar</i> (“wilderness” or “desert”) appears over 270 times in the Old Testament. The majority of these references are found in the Pentateuch, where the saga of the “wilderness experience” of the Israelites unfolds. Subsequent references to <i>midbar</i> often recall the great exodus from Egypt and the wanderings of the descendants of Jacob in Sinai. In those long years they became familiar with many desert species that are now recorded for us in the Bible, species like acacia, broom, boxthorn, date palm, juniper, tamarisk, terebinth, and styrax. They would also have known many others that are not recorded in Scripture. After the conquest of Canaan, the southern part of the country, called <i>Negev</i> (“dry”), became synonymous with “desert.” The Jews who settled there knew its plants and depended on them.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In this chapter we deal with twenty-six trees and shrubs that grew in the uncultivated areas of the Holy Land. The forest, streamside, and desert trees have been mentioned above. We include here two others that were imported from elsewhere, namely ebony from Africa and sandalwood from India.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In at least half of the cases, botanists agree on the identification of the wild trees. The conifers (pine, fir, cypress, cedar) are a particular problem, and debate continues to the present. Following Zohary and others, we propose that the Hebrew word <i>berosh</i> be taken as a generic word covering the Cilician fir, the Grecian juniper, and the cypress. Likewise, there is considerable uncertainty about the streamside trees and about styrax.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0001_acacia"/>The plural form of <i>shittah</i> (<i>shittim</i>) is used sometimes as a place name (<s>00402500100012</s>; <s>00403304900018</s>; <s>00600200100016</s>; <s>00600300100022</s>; <s>02800500200006</s>; <s>02900401800068</s>; <s>03300600500036</s>), which is evidence of the wide distribution of this tree in Sinai and southern Palestine. The acacia referred to in the Bible was of two kinds, the Umbrella Thorn Acacia <i>Acacia tortilis</i> and the Common Acacia <i>Acacia raddiana</i>.</Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>The <i>Acacia tortilis</i> is found in the hot Arabah Valley, whereas the <i>Acacia raddiana</i> tends to be found in cooler conditions throughout Sinai. A third variety (<i>Acacia albida</i>) is found in lowland Israel, the Sharon Plain, and lower Galilee. The common acacia was the only tree available to the Israelites for construction of the Tabernacle. Hareuveni discusses the problem of getting enough acacia trees in the wilderness for all the Tabernacle furniture including the 15 meter (50 foot) pole that ran the length of the side wall. He assures us that although most acacias are smaller, there are some that reached 15 meters in height. But would there be a piece straight enough even in a 15 meter acacia to use as a side pole? I doubt it. Then again, they could have joined short pieces to make a long one. Indeed, a collapsable pole would have made transport easier. According to Herodotus, boats on the Nile were made of acacia wood.

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Since the acacia is widespread in dry areas of Africa, Arabia, India and Australia, translators in those areas should be able to use a local word. Palgrave lists forty-three species in southern Africa alone. Hausa (Nigeria, Chad, Niger) has at least twelve words referring to acacias. In such languages a local species should be used, especially one that is used for building. Elsewhere, if none of these is available, the translator can transliterate from Hebrew (<i>shittah</i>) or from a major language, for example, <i>sunt</i> or <i>talh</i> (Arabic), <i>akasiya</i> (English/French/Spanish via Latin). West African translators need to beware of confusing “acacia” and “cassia,” a common tree with yellow flowers.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0013_boxthorn_tree"/>In the fable of the trees in <s>00700900000000</s>, all the trees come to the <i>’atad</i> (“bramble” in the Revised Standard Version [<a>RSV</a> ]) and ask it to become their king. With the exception of Zohary, scholars have generally agreed that this is probably a reference to the Boxthorn <i>Lycium europaeum</i>. Zohary holds that it is more likely the Christ Thorn <i>Ziziphus spina-christi</i>. Both are thorny trees that are plentiful in the Near East, especially near Samaria in northern Israel, where Jotham, the teller of the fable, lived. The name “Christ thorn” (French <i>couronne-du-Christ</i>) reflects the tradition that this tree must also have been the source of the thorns that are referred to in the account of Christ’s crucifixion. The topic is widely debated, and there is little to confirm whether the “crown of thorns” came from this tree, or from one of many other prickly plants such as the thorny burnet, which is more common in the Jerusalem area. We advocate the majority opinion here, which is boxthorn (French <i>lycie d’Europe</i>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The word associations in Jotham’s fable are by no means clear, but he appears to use the <i>’atad</i> as a tree that is neither attractive nor very useful. Indeed, its fruit is barely edible, and it does not produce usable wood, or even effective shade, since the leaves are fairly small and sparse. The <i>’atad</i> is thorny, but whether that is significant in the fable is not clear. If the tree represents Abimelech, most readers would probably agree that he was a thorny character.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Jotham’s fable, being an allegory, allows the option for translators to substitute rhetorically equivalent species for the olive, fig, grapevine, and boxthorn. However, there may be no single word for “boxthorn” in the receptor language, so translators will end up using a generic phrase like “thorn tree” or substituting a thorny local tree or shrub, probably the most common one in their area. A common problem is that languages often do not have names for plants that are not useful. If transliterations are needed, <i>atad</i> can be used from Hebrew, or translators can use a transliteration from a major language for a related type of tree, for example, Spanish <i>cambron</i> or <i>azufaifa</i>, French <i>jujubier</i>, and Portuguese <i>acufaifa</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0091_broom"/>A number of scholars identify <i>rothem</i> as the White Broom <i>Retama raetam</i>, a tough desert shrub found in the Holy Land and Arabia. Earlier, Moldenke contended that <i>rothem</i> refers to a parasitic plant called dog’s club. In the story of Elijah’s flight from Jezebel, the mention of the broom tree in <s>01101900400028</s> provides detail to the image of desolation brought to mind by the word “wilderness” earlier in the verse. The references to <i>rothem</i> in <s>01912000400012</s> (“… with glowing coals of the broom tree”) and <s>01803000400016</s> (“… and to warm themselves the roots of the broom”) have led scholars to conclude that it is indeed the broom shrub, since it makes a very hot fire, due to the oil in the stems and leaves. The place name Rithmah (“place of rothem”) referred to in <s>00403301800016 00403301900008</s> may also refer to the broom. The white broom is found on hills, rocky places, ravines and sandy places throughout the Holy Land, especially near the Dead Sea, in Gilead, on Mount Carmel, in the Syrian desert, and on the Phoenician coast.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In <s>01101900400028</s> the New Jerusalem Bible [<a>NJB</a> ] renders <i>rothem</i> as “furze bush,” also known as “gorse,” in an attempt to use a name known to English gardeners, but neither “gorse” nor “furze” are familiar to botanically ignorant city-dwellers of the twenty-first century. Likewise, the German <i>Ginsterstrauch</i> in the German common language version (<a>GECL</a>) is not well known. Hence, some modern versions use a generic term in 1 Kings, such as “large bush” (Contemporary English Version [<a>CEV</a> ]), “tree” (Good News Bible [<a>GNB</a> ], and “bush” (New Century Version [<a>NCV</a> ]). In areas where plants are still known by species names, translators can select a shrub that grows in dry, barren areas (assuming it is big enough to offer shade), or transliterate from the Hebrew (<i>rothem</i>) or a major language (for example, <i>retem</i> in Arabic). Otherwise, they can use “small tree” or “shrub.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>01912000400012</s> a local kind of wood that produces a very hot fire could be used, since the text is rhetorical, and needs an image of something very hot.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The reference to broom in <s>01803000400016</s> poses major textual and exegetical problems, which explains the variety of renderings in modern Bibles. <a>RSV</a> reads “they pick mallow and the leaves of bushes, and to warm themselves the roots of the broom.” <a>GNB</a> and the New International Version (<a>NIV</a>) have these poor folk <i>eating</i> the roots of the broom tree. However, reliable sources tell us that the root of the broom tree is poisonous. That is why Moldenke suggested that it must be another plant, namely the parasite Dog’s Club <i>Cynomorium coccineum</i>, which grows up out of the roots of the broom tree. However, there is good evidence that the writer intended to say the roots were “burned” (as in <a>RSV</a>), not “eaten” (as in <a>GNB</a> and <a>NIV</a>). Hanni Kuhn, writing in <i>The Bible Translator</i>, advises three options for translators of the two difficult lines of this verse, two of which we put forward here (the third, following Moldenke’s suggestion of dog’s club, has had less support and we are not promoting it):</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. They pluck saltplant [orache] leaves for food,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>the roots of broom they burn for warmth.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Here the letters <i>l-ch-m-m</i> of the final Hebrew word are read as <i>lchumam</i> (“to warm themselves”). This is followed by <a>RSV</a> and Moffatt (<a>Mft</a>), based on a change in the vowels that were added to the Hebrew text. (For “saltplant,” see <l target="FLORA:3.5.10">3.5.10 Orache (saltwort)</l>)</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. They pluck saltplant leaves to eat,</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>and sell/make embers/coals [charcoal] of broom to earn their bread.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In this rendering <i>l-ch-m-m</i> is read as <i>lachmam</i> (“their bread/food”). This second view is supported by Hareuveni (pages 31–32).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0113_cassiasenna"/>A book on Bible plants would not be complete without some reference to the famous “burning bush” from which God revealed his sacred name to Moses in the Sinai Desert. It seems that the less evidence we have for something, the more vigorous is the debate! The most touted guess is that it is the Bramble <i>Rubus sanguineus</i>. This is implausible, even though enthusiastically promoted by the staff of the St. Catherine’s monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai, where a specimen of <i>Rubus sanguineus</i> has been planted. Apart from this individual plant, there is no evidence that any species of <i>Rubus</i> has ever grown in Sinai or even in southern Israel. The same is probably also true of <i>Acacia nilotica</i>, although that has been promoted by the botanists Moldenke and Tristram.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Zohary believes <i>seneh</i> to be <i>Cassia senna</i>, and argues strongly against the opinion that the “bush” is a species of <i>Rubus</i>. He also argues against the <i>Acacia nilotica</i> as a candidate because that has never grown in Sinai. Other possibilities are that the bush was a hawthorn (which has red fruits) or an acacia shrub that had a red-flowered parasite growing on it. Hepper states that it is impossible to tell. He says that the search for a single species is futile, and that the incident should be considered a manifestation of the “glory of the Lord” like that of <s>01400700100000</s>, where “the dazzling light of the <a>LORD</a> ’s presence filled the Temple” (<a>GNB</a>). Among all the suggestions that have been made, four stand out as being botanically plausible, considering what sort of plants may have grown in the area of Mount Sinai at that time:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. the Senna Bush <i>Cassia senna</i> (Arabic <i>sene</i>);</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. the hawthorn bush, which has red fruit that might suggest flames;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. any acacia that might have had a red-colored parasite called <i>Loranthus acaciae</i>;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>4. the plant <i>Colutea istria</i>, which grows on Mount Sinai and has bright yellow flowers suggesting flames.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Note that all the furor described above is about what species <i>seneh</i> refers to. It is quite possible that it is a generic word like “shrub.” Unfortunately, many languages do not have a generic word for bush or shrub; they only have “tree” and “grass.” In West African English the word “bush” refers to an uninhabited wilderness area. Every year people “burn the bush,” and in a number of places translators have mistakenly used this concept in their translations of this passage and in <s>00503301600020</s> where “him that dwelt in the bush” is particularly confusing to many West Africans. In the absence of a word for “shrub,” it may be necessary to use “tree.” To make the miraculous nature of the burning bush incident sensible, it may be useful to say “green tree” or “leafy tree.” The reference to <i>seneh</i> in <s>00503301600020</s> appears to refer back to the incident in <s>00200300000000</s> (though the New Revised Standard Version [<a>NRSV</a> ] renders <i>seneh</i> as “Sinai”), and the majority of translations make that connection explicit (for example, <a>GNB</a>, the New Living Translation [<a>NLT</a> ], the Revised English Bible [<a>REB</a> ], and the New Jewish Publication Society Version [<a>NJPSV</a> ]).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0019_cedar_tree"/>Long ago the majestic cedars of Lebanon (<i>Cedrus libani</i>) completely covered the upper slopes of the Lebanon Mountains on the western and northern sides. Now only a few pockets of these mighty cedars remain. At that time they were mixed, as they are today, with other trees such as Cilician fir, Grecian juniper, cypress, and Calabrian pine.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>We know from 1 Kings that Solomon used cedar wood in his palace and in the Temple. Cedar was used for beams, boards, pillars, and ceilings. Historians tell us that the Assyrians also hauled cedars to their land for use in buildings. Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon also imported cedars from Lebanon. In some versions of Isaiah we read that people made idols of cedar and oak (<s>02304401401000 02304401501000 02304401601000 02304401701000 02304401801000 02304401901000 02304402001000</s>). Finally, when the Temple was rebuilt by the returning exiles (<s>01500300701000</s>), they again cut down cedar trees to grace the house of God.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In 2 Samuel, 1–2 Kings, 1–2 Chronicles and Ezra, when Lebanon is specifically mentioned, there can be no doubt that <i>’erez</i> is <i>Cedrus libani</i>, the “cedar of Lebanon,” although it is possible that sometimes the word was used loosely to include various evergreen trees.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the description of the purification rituals (<s>00301400401032 00301400601024 00301404901024 00301405101012 00301405201052 00401900601012</s>), the word <i>’erez</i> probably refers to the Phoenician juniper tree (see <l target="FLORA:1.11.2">1.11.2 Phoenician juniper (coastal juniper)</l>), since that was the only cedar-like tree in the Sinai Desert. Zohary, however, suggests that in those barren lands even the tamarisk, with its cedar-like “leaves,” might have qualified as “cedar” in these rituals.</Paragraph>

The leaves of true cedars are not flat like those of most trees, but consist of tufts of dark green, shiny spines. (The cedars in North America have a flatter type of spine than the biblical cedar.) The wood is fragrant and resistant to insects. Cedars bear cones and can live to be two or three thousand years old.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><i>Cedrus</i> species are found in the mountains of North Africa, in the Himalayas, in India, and in North America. Translators in these places, should, of course, use the local name in nonfigurative references. In sub-Saharan Africa, translators can transliterate from Hebrew (<i>erets</i>), Greek (<i>kedar</i>), English (<i>sedar</i>), or another major language, or they can take a generic solution such as “large, beautiful tree.” In poetic passages (wisdom literature and prophecy), some translators may wish to use a cultural equivalent with these traits. In Africa, according to Burkhill, the Pink Mahogany <i>Guarea cedrata</i> is also called the pink African cedar because of the cedar-like scent of its timber. Likewise, some people in India and Australia use “cedar” to refer to the toon because of its reddish wood. I do not recommend such substitutes in historical passages, since the <i>’erez</i> is not related to these trees. In some figurative passages, however, the substitution could be effective, since all are large trees with reddish wood. However, each passage has to be evaluated to determine the intended effect of the image.</Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>’oren</i> in <s>02304401400008</s> is translated “cedar” by <a>RSV</a>, the Jerusalem Bible (<a>JB</a>) and the New English Bible (<a>NEB</a>), and “ash” by the King James Version (<a>KJV</a>). This word probably refers to the bay laurel (see <l target="FLORA:1.12">1.12 Laurel (bay tree)</l>). <i>’Oren</i> in modern Hebrew refers to the Aleppo pine (see <l target="FLORA:1.18.2">1.18.2 Aleppo pine</l>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01903703500014</s>: There are two positions here based on varying Hebrew texts:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. following the reading <i>ke’erez halevanon</i> yields “like a cedar of Lebanon” (<a>RSV</a>, <a>GNB</a>, <a>JB</a>, Septuagint);</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. following the reading <i>ke’ezrach ra‘anan</i> yields “like a luxuriant native tree” (so <a>CEV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, <a>NCV</a>, <a>REB</a>, <a>NJPSV</a>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew Old Testament Text Project (<a>HOTTP</a>) favors the latter reading <i>ke’ezrach ra‘anan</i> with a B rating: “like a native [tree], greening.” <a>KJV</a> translates “like a green bay tree,” but there is no recent scholarly support for this interpretation. Thus, option 2 above is probably best.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0023_cypress_tree"/>The Hebrew word <i>berosh</i> probably covered cypress, fir, and juniper; we are including here only those instances of <i>berosh</i> that possibly refer specifically to the cypress. The Cypress <i>Cupressus sempervirens</i>, native to Israel, was once common in the mountains of Judea. It also grew abundantly in Lebanon along with cedars, firs, and Grecian junipers. Cypresses also grew in Judea, Gilead and Edom, and do so up to the present day.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A comparison of versions reflects the disagreement among scholars on the identification of the coniferous trees. For example, the Hebrew word <i>berosh</i> in <s>01100502201048</s> (8) is translated as follows:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>“cypress” (<a>RSV</a>, <a>NRSV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, Living Bible [<a>LB</a> ], <a>NJPSV</a>; Brown, Driver and Briggs lexicon [<a>BDB</a> ], Keil and Delitzsch)</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>“pine” (<a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>NCV</a>, <a>REB</a>, <i>Fauna and Flora of the Bible</i> [<a>FFB</a> ])</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>“juniper” (<a>NJB</a>)</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>“fir” (New American Bible [<a>NAB</a> ])</Paragraph>
              <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0169_cypress_cone"/>The disagreement here arises from the fact that <i>berosh</i> is probably a generic term, and it should probably be translated generically, if possible, or differently according to the context. Following the opinion of Zohary and others, we take the word <i>berosh</i> in 1–2 Kings and 2 Chronicles, where it is usually paired with <i>’erez</i> (“cedar”) and/or Lebanon, to refer to the Cilician fir (see <l target="FLORA:1.9">1.9 Fir</l>) or to the Grecian juniper (see <l target="FLORA:1.11.1">1.11.1 Grecian juniper (eastern savin)</l>) rather than to the cypress. In the few other places where it occurs, it may refer to any one of the three conifers. The logic here is that since cypresses grew in Judea, King Solomon would not need to import them from Lebanon. However, it could also be argued that Lebanon may have produced better specimens than King Solomon could find in Israel and he might have imported some of them. In either case, this does not argue against <i>berosh</i> as a generic term.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Hepper appears to agree with Zohary. Hareuveni identifies <i>berosh</i> as juniper. Thus, if <i>berosh</i> does refer to a single species, current scholarly opinion would support “fir” or “juniper,” but not “cypress” or “pine.” It is quite possible that <i>berosh</i> and its cognates <i>burasu</i> (Akkadian) and <i>brotha</i> (Lebanese Arabic) have been used at different times both as generic terms and as specific terms for one of the conifers.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Regarding the <i>gofer</i> wood that Noah used for his ark (<s>00100601400010</s>), little can be known until actual specimens turn up on Mount Ararat. Meanwhile, Moldenke and others thought that the wood used to build the ark may have been cypress, and this is found in Moffatt’s version. But pieces of the ark that were allegedly found by French explorers in the 1970s turned out to be oak dating from the sixth or seventh century <a>A.D.</a> Cypress is very durable. The similarity of the Hebrew word <i>gofer</i> with <i>kofer</i> (“bitumen”) suggests perhaps a resinous tree. Hence, others have ventured “pine” or “cedar.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Closely related to the pines, firs and cedars, the cypress may reach 9–15 meters (30–50 feet) high. It has small scale-like leaves and round cones. The tall, narrow specimens that are common today in Israel and other countries are a modern variety (<i>pyramidalis</i>) that has been specially developed.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In the following passages <i>berosh</i> seems to suggest something exotic:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02200101700012</s> - “the beams of our house are cedar, our rafters are <i>berothim</i>.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02306001300018</s> - “the glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the <i>berosh</i>, the plane, and the pine, to beautify … my sanctuary … .”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Whether <i>berosh</i> was generic or specific, a number of poetical passages use it to represent something special without specifying the particular quality in focus; for example, the third line of <s>02801400900028</s> (8) says “I am like a <i>berosh</i>.” In this passage <a>GNB</a> takes the function of the tree to be protection, whereas <a>NLT</a> brings out the ever-green aspect of the tree. In other passages the shape and smell of the tree may be important.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Isaiah uses <i>berosh</i> to represent a mountain tree that will grace the desert in the coming age:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02304101900032</s> - “I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia … I will set in the desert the <i>berosh</i>… .”</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>If a generic word for evergreen conifers exists in the receptor language, then that could be used as a cover term for all the cases of <i>berosh</i>. If not, a phrase such as “strong and beautiful tree/wood” can be used in many places, or a transliteration from a major language, for example, <i>firi</i>, <i>piro</i>, <i>junipa</i> or <i>yunifer</i>, for the references in 1–2 Kings, 2 Chronicles, and Song of Songs (and <i>kupresi</i> or <i>sipres</i> elsewhere). Where there is no indigenous evergreen tree, it is best not to try to find a substitute. In <s>00100601400010</s> we advocate “strong wood” or a transliteration.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02602700600020</s>: There are textual variations here depending on what vowels you insert in the consonantal Hebrew text for <i>b-t-’-sh-r-m</i> and how you divide the words in this phrase. It may be read <i>bat-’ashurim</i> or <i>bite’ashurim</i>). <a>KJV</a> takes the first option and interprets <i>’ashurim</i> as refering to the people of Ashur (Assyria). Most scholars and versions now take it to refer to some kind of wood (“boxwood” in <a>NEB</a> and <a>NJPSV</a>; “cypress” in <a>NIV</a>; “pine” in <a>RSV</a>, <a>GNB</a>, and <a>NLT</a>). The context here is rhetorical, but it gets its dramatic force from the mass of detailed information about the geography, history, and trading practices of the time, so we like to have specific words for <i>berosh</i>, <i>’erez</i> (verse 5), <i>’allon</i>, and <i>te’ashur</i> (verse 6). The translation (or transliteration) of <i>te’ashur</i> here will depend on what the translator has done with the other terms. We suggest transliterating from Hebrew (together with a classifier “wood” or “tree”) by saying “… <i>berosh</i> wood from Senir … <i>erez</i> wood from Lebanon … <i>allon</i> wood from Bashan … <i>te’ashur</i> wood from the coast of Cyprus.” Transliterations from a major language are also possible.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02603100301004</s>: The second word of the Hebrew in this verse (<i>’ashur</i>) is emended by some scholars to read <i>te’ashur</i> (compare <s>02304101900038</s>; <s>02306001300018</s>) and taken as a reference to the cypress. The third Hebrew word (<i>’erez</i>) refers to the cedar. The consensus of scholars now takes <i>’ashur</i> as referring to Assyria rather than to a tree. Only <i>Traduction œcuménique de la Bible</i> (<a>TOB</a>) renders it as “cypress.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>03400200400034</s> (3): Literally, the last line of this verse says “the <i>beroshim</i> tremble.” The versions are divided into two camps on the exegesis of this line:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. <a>NIV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, and God’s Word (<a>GW</a>) accept the Hebrew text as it is and take <i>beroshim</i> to refer to arrows or spears made from the wood of <i>berosh</i>, and “tremble” refers to these weapons being waved above the heads of the warriors.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. <a>RSV</a>, <a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, <a>NCV</a>, <a>REB</a>, <a>NAB</a>, <a>JB</a>, and <a>NJB</a> emend the consonants of <i>beroshim</i> to read “horses.” In this case, “tremble” is taken to mean “prance” (<a>RSV</a>, <a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>), “be impatient for action” (<a>NJB</a>), or “advance” (<a>REB</a>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>A Handbook on The Books of Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah</i> considers both interpretations as equally likely. Translators are urged to follow a concensus of major versions in their area and footnote the alternative.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01000600500028</s>: Two positions are evident for the Hebrew phrase that is literally “with all the wood of <i>beroshim</i> ”:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. <a>RSV</a>, <a>NRSV</a>, <a>GNB</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, <a>REB</a>, <a>NAB</a>, <a>JB</a>, and <a>NJB</a> follow one manuscript of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Septuagint, and the parallel passage (<s>01301300801000</s>), which say “with all their might, with songs.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. <a>KJV</a>, <a>NCV</a>, <a>NJPSV</a>, <a>TOB</a>, the International Children’s Bible (<a>ICB</a>), the New American Standard Bible (<a>NASB</a>), the French common language version (<a>FRCL</a>), <i>La Sainte Bible: Nouvelle Version Segond révisée</i> (<a>NVSR</a>), and <i>La Sainte Bible: La Bible du Semeur</i> (<a>SEM</a>) follow the Masoretic Text (<a>MT</a>) <i>berosh</i> and take <i>beroshim</i> to refer to instruments made of “fir” (<a>KJV</a>, <a>NASB</a>), “cypress” (<a>NJPSV</a>, <a>NVSR</a>, <a>SEM</a>, <a>TOB</a>), or “pine” (<a>ICB</a>, <a>FRCL</a>), just as it may refer to spears or arrows in <s>03400200301000</s>. This seems to be supported by <a>HOTTP</a>, which gives a C rating to the <a>MT</a>. The alternative interpretation is included in footnotes in <a>NIV</a> (“pine”), <a>GNB</a> (“fir”), <a>NLT</a> (“cypress”), and <a>REB</a> (“beating of batons”).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Given a choice between following the <a>MT</a> and following the Septuagint, we recommend following the <a>MT</a>, but suggest taking <i>beroshim</i> as “precious wood.” The translation then would say “musical instruments of precious wood.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0196_ebony"/>Ezekiel reports traders who brought <i>hovnim</i> to Tyre. Coupled with ivory, the Hebrew word <i>hovnim</i> could have referred to either Asian or African products. In 1982 Zohary stated that the identity of the <i>hovnim</i> in Ezekiel is unclear. He said that at best we can say that both Asian and African merchandise were shipped to Dedan, a Phoenician commercial center on the Arabian coast. Since then, however, Hepper, who believes that trading with the Far East was less than many other scholars have alleged, has said that this tree is not the Asian Ebony <i>Diospyros ebenum</i> we know today but a leguminous tree <i>Dalbergia melanoxylon</i>, which grows all across Africa along the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. Evidence for this, he says, is that the Old Egyptian cognate <i>hbny</i> found in hieroglyphs refers to <i>Dalbergia melanoxylon</i>.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>If <i>hovnim</i> are from Africa, they could be <i>Dalbergia melanoxylon</i>, as Hepper asserts, or one of the many species of the genus <i>Diospyros</i> found throughout the continent, such as <i>Diospyros mespiliformis</i>. The latter is a huge, widespread forest tree up to 35 meters (115 feet) tall. <i>Dalbergia melanoxylon</i> is a smaller, spiny tree reaching a height of 6–7 meters (20–23 feet). It inhabits the dry savanna areas from Ethiopia across to Senegal and as far south as southern Africa, where it is called “zebrawood.” The leaves are compound, with the leaflets nearly opposite one another on the spine. It has white flowers that hang in loose clusters, and around October they give way to flat, papery seedpods about 6 centimeters (2.5 inches) long and 1 centimeter (1/2 inch) wide. The Asian ebony, if that is what <i>hovnim</i> refers to, is found in India and Sri Lanka, grows to 10 meters (33 feet) tall, and has evergreen leaves. The inner part of the trunk is black, which makes it an attractive wood for carvers, who inlay the wood with ivory.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>There are hundreds of species of ebony in tropical areas of the world (eighty in the Americas, ninety-four in Africa, and two hundred in Asia). In Africa the tree that produces most of the true ebony is <i>Diospyros mespiliformis</i>, which is found all the way from Senegal to the Red Sea and Arabia and southward to Southwest Africa and the Transvaal (Keay, Dalziel, and Hutchinson). In Nigeria it is called <i>kanran</i> or <i>kanyan</i> (Fulani <i>nel'bi</i>, Kanuri <i>bergem</i>). Surprisingly, both the Yoruba and Igbo Bibles in Nigeria have used <i>eboni</i>, perhaps reflecting the urbanization and Anglicization of those societies (or at least of the translators!). The Hausa word <i>kanya</i> correctly refers to the ebony tree. <i>Diospyrus ebenum</i>, found in India and Sri Lanka, might possibly have been on the world market in Bible times. A local word for this tree could be used in translations. If Hepper is correct, then the <i>Dalbergia melanoxylon</i>, locally known in Africa as “ebony” and also used for carving, should be used. Other transliteration possibilities are <i>ebene</i> (French) and <i>ebenuz</i> (Spanish).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Dalbergia</i> species are also found in Central and South America under the names of palisander, kingwood, or tulipwood. A species in India is called blackwood or rosewood. In all these places the wood is used for radio cabinets, musical instruments, buttons, knife handles, chess pieces, and decorative carvings for tourists.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0204_elm"/>In Isaiah’s description of the idol carver’s work, we find a sentence that says “he plants a cedar and the rain nourishes it” (Hebrew <i>nata‘ ’oren wegeshem yegadel</i>). The clause “and the rain nourishes it” has always seemed strange in the context. So Zohary emends <i>geshem</i> (“rain”) here to read <i>neshem</i>, which is the word for the Hairy Elm (<i>Ulmus canescens</i>) in Arabic. Given the very close similarity between the letters <i>nun</i> and <i>gimel</i> in Hebrew, and the syntax, it is tempting to conclude that another tree is being suggested. According to Zohary’s emendation, there is a possible parallelism between <i>tirzah we’allon</i> (“stone pine and oak”) in <s>02304401400014</s> a and <i>’oren weneshem</i> (“laurel and elm”) in <s>02304401400034</s> b. Zohary’s hypothesis is based on the assumption that the original Hebrew word was similar to the Arabic word <i>neshem</i> (that is, beginning with the letter <i>nun</i>), and that a scribe at some point substituted the <i>gimel</i> for the very similar letter <i>nun</i> of the original text. I know of no Bible scholar who has considered this possibility. The Septuagint says “rain.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The <a>KJV</a> translation of <i>’elah</i> as “elm” in <s>02800401301032</s> is botanically incorrect. It should be “terebinth.”</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>No translator at this date has taken up the suggestion to include the elm tree in this verse. If Zohary’s hypothesis is confirmed, however, we encourage translators to take it seriously. How it is handled in translation will depend on what the translator has done with the three other species in the verse: stone pine, oak, and laurel. If the translator takes those three rhetorically, and substitutes an equivalent species that is used for the making of idols, then the same should be done with <i>neshem</i>. If the others are transliterated from a major language, then <i>neshem</i> will also be transliterated, as, perhaps, <i>elem</i> /<i>elmu</i> (from English) or <i>ulum</i> /<i>ulmu</i> (from Latin).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Ulmus</i> species are found in temperate climates throughout the world. They are planted along streets for shade, and the wood is used for furniture, tool handles, coffins, chair seats, wheel hubs, mallet heads, and many other things.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0220_fir"/>The Cilician Fir <i>Abies cilicica</i> grew abundantly in the forests of Lebanon along with cedars, evergreen cypresses, and Grecian junipers. The Hebrew word <i>berosh</i> probably included fir, cypress, and juniper. According to <s>01100502200048</s> (8) and elsewhere, <i>berosh</i> was used in King Solomon’s building projects. The reference in <s>02602700501002</s> to the use of <i>berosh</i> for the timbers/planks of ships could well be talking about fir trees since they are very straight, but the association of <i>berosh</i> there with Mount Senir rather favors the Grecian juniper, which was abundant there (see <l target="FLORA:1.11.1">1.11.1 Grecian juniper (eastern savin)</l>). Hepper (page 163) notes that in Bible times firs were shipped to Egypt for the masts in front of temple pylons, and there is strong evidence that fir trees were used for masts in ancient Greece. One bit of linguistic evidence that <i>berosh</i> could refer to this fir is that the Akkadian word <i>burasu</i>, cognate with <i>berosh</i>, probably refers to the Cilician Fir <i>Abies cephalonica</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The <i>Abies</i> genus is represented throughout the world in temperate climates at high altitudes (for example, in Kenya, Japan, and North America). Since there are no firs or anything quite like them in tropical Africa, translators can use a transliteration, for example, <i>firi</i> or <i>pir</i>. In <s>02602700501002</s> we recommend following Zohary by rendering <i>berosh</i> as “fir” (so <a>RSV</a>, <a>GNB</a>, <a>NCV</a>). The majority of English translations are divided among “fir,” “cypress,” and “pine.” In 1–2 Kings and 2 Chronicles we recommend rendering <i>berosh</i> as “fir” or “juniper.” Elsewhere <i>berosh</i> may be considered a generic word referring to cypress, fir, pine, or all of them together. In those places a general word for this type of cone-bearing tree should be used (see also the discussion under <l target="FLORA:1.6">1.6 Cypress</l>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0540_ivy"/>Some readers may not think of Ivy <i>Hedera helix</i> as a “tree,” but we include it here because, like “proper trees” it has a thick, woody stem. People in cities, who only see it climbing the walls of buildings, need to be reminded that it also grows in forests. The two references in Scripture are in the Deuterocanon, where we read of ivy wreaths being worn by those in the procession for Dionysus, the Greek god of fruitfulness and vegetation, and of people being branded with an ivy-leaf symbol of Dionysus.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Since <s>07800600700042</s> refers to a wreath or crown made of ivy, some translators may prefer to use a generic description that does not include the species. If the species name is to be included, as it might be in a study Bible, a transliteration of ivy from a major language is recommended together with a classifier identifying the transliteration as a climbing plant, if such is available. If not, the word for “shrub” or “tree” can be used as a classifier together with a transliteration such as <i>kisos</i> (Greek), <i>hedera</i> (Latin), or one from a major local language.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0090_juniper_tree_grecian"/>A tall evergreen, the Grecian Juniper <i>Juniperus excelsa</i>, also known as the Eastern Savin, grew in the mountains of Lebanon along with cedars, firs, and cypress (the Hebrew word <i>berosh</i> probably covered all three of these trees). The association of <i>berosh</i> with Mount Senir in <s>02602700500002</s> argues for the Grecian juniper there, since Mount Senir was known to have plenty of Grecian junipers. Lebanese people up to today refer to the juniper as <i>brotha</i>, a likely cognate with <i>berosh</i>. King Solomon undoubtedly hauled these trees to Jerusalem along with cedars and firs to use in constructing his palace and the Temple of Yahweh. The Israeli botanist Hareuveni advocates translating <i>berosh</i> as juniper, presumably the Grecian species.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>There is no single Hebrew or Greek word that refers specifically to the Grecian juniper. In our discussion of cypress and fir, we have advocated translating <i>berosh</i> generically or as “fir” or “juniper” in 1–2 Kings and 2 Chronicles (where it is typically associated with Lebanon or cedar). If no generic word is available in the receptor language, a descriptive phrase such as “strong, beautiful tree/wood” can be used. In poetical passages like <s>02801400900028</s>; <s>02603100800014</s>; and <s>03801100200004</s>, local poetic equivalents could be considered.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0091_juniper_tree_phoenician"/>The Phoenician Juniper <i>Juniperus phoenicea</i> is a lower-altitude cousin of the Grecian juniper discussed in the previous entry. At present it is found scattered throughout the mountains of northern Sinai and southern Jordan, and Hepper notes that it occurs throughout the higher parts of Sinai and Arabia. In ancient times it may have been found throughout the Negev. <s>00500203600004</s> refers to a town on the edge of the Wadi Arnon called Aroer, which is probably cognate with the Hebrew word <i>‘ar‘ar</i>, indicating that these trees may have grown there. The identification of <i>‘ar‘ar</i> /<i>‘aro‘er</i> as the Phoenician juniper is supported by the fact that Arabs in several countries call this juniper <i>‘ar‘ar</i>. Since it is closely related to the cedars, some people also call it the “Phoenician cedar.” Note that Hebrew uses the same word <i>’erez</i> to cover both the Phoenician juniper and the mighty cedar of Lebanon. For <i>‘ar‘ar</i>  in <s>02401700600008</s>, Nogah HaReuveni (Desert and Shepherd in our Biblical Heritage, p 67-71) makes a <i>literary</i>  case for the “apple of Sodom” (<i>Calotropis procera</i>). The Sodom apple, which lives in an “uninhabited salt land,” has attractive green leaves and fruit, but the fruit turns out to be hollow and toxic -- a strong contrast with the fruitful tree that lives by a stream. However, other botanists have not followed this, relying more on the linguistic evidence from Arabic.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Following Zohary, we advocate translating <i>’erez</i> as “juniper” in Leviticus and Numbers, if that species is known, or using a transliteration from a major language. The reference to <i>‘ar‘ar</i> in <s>02401700600008</s> is poetic, and a cultural equivalent may be used. As the Sodom apple is common throughout Africa and Asia, the local word for "Sodom apple" may be useful. Some scholars take the Hebrew word <i>‘aro‘er</i> in the last line of <s>02404800600014</s> as meaning “juniper.” There is a textual problem with the Hebrew word. There are four positions:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. Transliterate the Hebrew and render this line as “Be like Aroer in the desert” (so <a>NJPSV</a>). Aroer was a desert town.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. Amend <i>‘aro‘er</i> to read <i>‘arod</i>, and render this line as “Be like a wild donkey in the desert” (so <a>RSV</a>, <a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, <a>NJB</a>, <a>NAB</a>). The Hebrew letters for “r” and “d” are very similar.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. Take <i>‘aro‘er</i> as a reference to a juniper shrub on the basis of the Arabic use of <i>‘arar</i> for juniper. <a>NCV</a> comes close to this by saying “Go like a bush being blown through the desert.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>4. Read <i>‘aro‘er</i> as <i>‘ar‘ar</i>, which means “destitute.” <a>REB</a> does this by saying “and become like one destitute in the desert.”</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The Laurel <i>Laurus nobilis</i> is the source of bay leaf used in European cooking up to today. It must have been common in Israel in biblical times, and was used for oil, as a spice in food, and in medicine. It has a fresh, pleasing smell. It was abundant in Carmel, where it is plentiful to the present, and on the other mountains, Tabor, Gilead and Hermon. However, we only have two very debatable references to the laurel tree in the Bible. One is <s>02304401400034</s>, which refers to the making of idols: “… he plants <i>’oren</i> [‘cedar’ in <a>RSV</a> ] and the rain nourishes it.” The other is <s>01903703500006</s>, where the Hebrew word <i>‘oritz</i> may not refer to a plant at all. In <s>02304401400034</s> the letter <i>n</i> in the Hebrew word <i>’oren</i> was marked as suspicious by the Masoretes, leading later scholars to take the root <i>’ar</i> as a reference to <i>’erez</i> (“cedar”). However, the reading <i>’oren</i> is probably correct.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Although <i>’oren</i> is used in modern Hebrew for the pine tree, the Aramaic translation, <i>Targum Jonathan</i>, has <i>’aranye</i> in this passage, the Arabic equivalent of which is <i>’ar</i>. Post-biblical writers use the name <i>’ar</i> for “laurel.” The botanist Thompson associates the Akkadian word <i>’eru</i> with the laurel. Zohary follows this line of thinking, and assumes that the biblical writers could not have ignored such a useful and lovely tree, so he implicitly advocates using it in <s>02304401400034</s>. Similarly, the botanist Moldenke favors laurel for <i>‘oritz</i> in <s>01903703500006</s> (<a>RSV</a> “overbearing”), but no version has followed that. <a>KJV</a> ’s “ash” for <i>’oren</i> in <s>02304401400034</s> is unsupported, although a type of ash known as the Syrian Ash <i>Fraxinus syriaca</i> is fairly common in Israel and may have been known in Bible times.</Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>In Bible times wreaths (<i>stemma</i> in Greek) were made from bunches of laurel leaves used to honor winning athletes, and they were also worn by the Roman emperors. Hence it is quite possible that the garlands mentioned in <s>04401401300026</s> were of laurel leaves. The victory wreaths referred to in <s>04600902500024</s>; <s>05500200500014</s>; and <s>06000500400020</s> would have been made of laurel leaves. Garlands are also mentioned in <s>02000100900004</s> and <s>02000400900008</s> (<i>liwyah</i> in Hebrew). If in fact the psalmist intended to refer to the laurel in <s>01903703500006</s>, it is used there as a symbol of the ostentatious prosperity of the wicked.

            <Paragraph>The laurel is found throughout the Mediterranean region and southern Europe. It belongs to a large family of trees called <i>Lauraceae</i> that has hundreds of species scattered about the tropical and warm climates of the world, especially in Southeast Asia and Brazil. Cinnamon trees, avocado trees, and magnolias are well-known trees from this family. Close relatives of the true bay tree are only found in the Azores (<i>Laurus azorica</i>). In places where the laurel/bay tree is known, it may be used in <s>02304401400034</s>. If not, a transliteration from a major language is recommended, such as <i>laurier</i> (French), <i>loureiro</i> /<i>louro</i> (Portuguese), <i>laurel</i> (Spanish). However, the translation of <i>’oren</i> will depend partly on what has been done with the other trees mentioned in <s>02304401400034</s>. If transliterations are used, they should be used throughout. If local species are substituted, they should be used throughout.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0580_laurustinus"/>The identification of the Hebrew word <i>tidhar</i> in <s>02304101900034</s> and <s>02306001300014</s> is controversial. <a>RSV</a> and <a>JB</a> both use “plane” in these verses, the only places where the word <i>tidhar</i> occurs. Other versions have “fir” (<a>CEV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, <a>REB</a>, <a>GW</a>), “box” (<a>NJPSV</a>), and “pine” (<a>KJV</a>, supported by Moldenke). Zohary’s identification of <i>tidhar</i> as the Laurustinus <i>Viburnum tinus</i> is based on the Aramaic translation, <i>Targum Jonathan</i>, which translates <i>tidhar</i> as <i>mornian</i>, a cognate with <i>murran</i>, which is the Arabic name for laurustinus. Hepper agrees with Zohary. <a>FFB</a> (following Moldenke) cautiously identifies <i>tidhar</i> as the Brutian (or Turkish) Pine <i>Pinus brutia</i>. <a>BDB</a> and some others follow the Vulgate in translating this as “elm,” noting that the Syriac name for the common elm is “dadar.” The most recent evidence supports the laurustinus. The alternative spelling “laurestinus” is less common.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The laurustinus belongs to a family of trees that live in temperate and warm climates, including Europe, Asia, and North America, but close relatives of laurustinus are found only in the Mediterranean area. Since “laurustinus” is not a well-known name, and rather bulky for transliteration, it is perhaps better to transliterate from a major version or from Hebrew <i>tidhar</i> or Arabic <i>murran</i>. However, the treatment of <i>tidhar</i> may depend on what the translator has done with the other words for trees in <s>02304101900032</s> and <s>02306001300012</s>. If <i>berosh</i> is translated or transliterated as “fir,” then a different word (for example, “plane,” following <a>RSV</a> and <a>JB</a>) should be used for <i>tidhar</i>. In a study Bible “laurustinus” could be cited as a probable identity of <i>tidhar</i>, although “pine” runs a close second.</Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>The identity of the tree or plant called <i>tse’elim</i> in Job as the habitat for the monster “Behemoth” has perplexed scholars for centuries, partly because the identity of the monster itself is unknown (see <i>All Creatures Great and Small</i>, <l target="FAUNA:7.1">7.1</l>). Surprisingly, neither Zohary nor Hepper comment on <i>tse’elim</i>. Attempts to identify the beast and its botanical context are perhaps futile, since on the surface they are mutually contradictory. If the beast is indeed a hippopotamus or a crocodile, then the Lotus Thorn <i>Ziziphus lotus</i> is out of place, since it does not grow near water. If <i>Ziziphus lotus</i> is correct, then the animal is not a hippopotamus or a crocodile, even allowing that these animals do come out for a siesta in the shade of a tree on the riverbank. As Moldenke says, judging by the references to reeds and willows in the context, <i>tse’elim</i> could be plane trees or oleander shrubs. And they could, of course, be actual lotus plants (so <a>RSV</a>), which grow in streams and which are otherwise not referred to in Scripture.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Since the identity of <i>tse’elim</i> is unknown, translators may wish to follow the lead of a major tradition in their area which assumes a watery environment (for example, <a>RSV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, and <a>NLT</a>) and translate it as “lotus plants.” Versions that generalize to “shady trees” offer another option (so <a>CEV</a>). <a>GNB</a> says “thorn bushes,” which apparently takes <i>tse’elim</i> to refer to the Christ thorn or boxthorn, and leaves the botanical dilemma to the curious reader.</Paragraph>

In the apocalyptic passage <s>02304101900016</s> it is listed with cedars, acacias, and olives (see also <s>02305501300026</s>), and we are told that in the new age these verdant trees will replace the thorny bushes of the wilderness. The Arabic <i>as</i> and the Akkadian <i>asu</i> are cognates of the Hebrew word <i>hadas</i>. The leaves and flowers of the myrtle are used in weddings and in medicine. The wood is used for walking sticks and furniture. The bark and roots yield tannin, used up to the present day in Russia and Turkey to prepare leather.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><s>01600801500056</s> tells us that branches of the myrtle and other trees were used to make shelters for the Festival of Shelters, a practice still followed by Jews today. The Isaiah references associate the myrtle with a time of renewal and goodness. Taken together we may conclude that when Zechariah situates his vision of horses and riders “among the myrtles,” he is thinking of a sacred place, a place of God’s presence, possibly even a “gateway to heaven,” although the use of the definite article may also point to a particular place that Zechariah and his readers knew about. Some commentators hold that the myrtles in Zechariah’s vision represent the people of Israel. Note that these myrtles are said to be growing in some kind of depression in the ground, whether a valley or ravine, which may itself be symbolic of a negative national experience, perhaps even the Babylonian Exile, as some have suggested.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew name for myrtle is used as a personal name by women (Hadassah; see <s>01700200700010</s>) as well as men (Assa).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Myrtles are part of the gigantic <i>Myrtaceae</i> family that includes at least three thousand species throughout the world, including the guava, the eucalyptus, and the clove. Close relatives of the myrtle, however, may be hard to find, so a transliteration from a major language may be the best option. In the poetical Isaiah passages the handling of <i>hadas</i> will depend on what the translator does with the other names of trees in the list, whether they use literary equivalents or transliterations. In Nehemiah, transliteration is advised, unless, of course, myrtle or a close relative of it is known. In Zechariah, since we do not know the significant features of the myrtle that the writer had in mind, it is difficult to make an appropriate descriptive equivalent. However, a transliteration or a generic phrase such as “shrubs” or “small, leafy trees” may be used.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0103_oak_tree"/>Three species of oak are found in Israel, the main ones being the Tabor oak and the Kermes (or common) oak. Both go by the name <i>’elon</i> or <i>’allon</i> in Hebrew. The similarity to the Hebrew word <i>’el</i> (“god”) is significant, since these trees have long been associated with worship and with burial. Since the Tabor oak is the biggest, it is likely that <i>’elon</i> and <i>’allon</i> most often refer to that one. English versions have sometimes mistakenly translated the Hebrew word <i>’elah</i> (“terebinth”) as “oak.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>According to Hepper, forests of Kermes oak (<i>Quercus calliprinos</i> or <i>Quercus coccifera</i>) covered the hill country of Israel from Carmel to Samaria in biblical times. The Kermes oak forest is the most familiar and important type of vegetation in Israel.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Tabor Oak <i>Quercus macrolepsis</i> (= <i>Quercus aegilops</i> = <i>Quercus ithaburensis</i> = Valonea oak in Israel) apparently replaced the original common oak during the Arab period (800–1400 <a>A.D.</a>), but has itself been nearly destroyed in more recent times by the efforts of charcoal makers, limestone burners, and the Turkish railway. Tabor oaks are deciduous and are found mostly in Carmel.</Paragraph>

In poetic contexts such as Psalms, Proverbs, and the prophets, the oak typically represents a large and very strong tree, and a local species with those characteristics can be considered.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0104_oleander_flowers"/>The Oleander <i>Nerium oleander</i> can be found throughout Israel from the Carmel range to the Jordan Valley, inhabiting especially the creek beds that fill with water after heavy rains. It has now become a popular garden shrub. Even in the dry area east of the Jordan it may be found in abundance. Zohary considers the place name “Ardat” in <s>08200902600022</s> to be related to the modern Hebrew word <i>harduf</i>, which refers to the oleander shrub. Hepper and others hold that the Greek word <i>rodon</i> in <s>07102401400018</s> and <s>07103901300016</s> refers to oleander, but a small majority identifies <i>rodon</i> as the Phoenician rose (see <l target="FLORA:6.1.5">6.1.5 Tulip (mountain tulip, “rose of Sharon”)</l>). <a>RSV</a> renders it “rose” in these passages. Some scholars have contended that the Hebrew word <i>‘aravah</i> (“willows” in <a>RSV</a>) in <s>00302304001000</s> must refer to the oleander, but there is no concrete evidence for it.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The oleander is a flowering shrub that can reach 1–4 meters (3–13 feet) in height and has narrow leaves like a willow. The flowers are pink, with doubled petals that make it look like a rose (hence “rose” in Sirach). The leaves, flowers, and milky resin are very toxic. The flowers usually appear in June and range from white to pink in color. The seed pod releases a fluffy seed that may be carried some distance by the wind.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0719_pine_stone"/>According to Tomson (1860, quoted by Zohary), the Stone Pine <i>Pinus pinea</i>, also known as the Pignolia or Piñon pine, was common in the coastal plain of Palestine in the 1800s. There were forests of them on the Aegean coast and in Lebanon. Israel now has only a few groves of them on Mount Carmel and on the coastal plain of Galilee, but they are plentiful in Lebanon, where people plant them for the tasty, oily seeds. Zohary suggests that the Hebrew word <i>tirzah</i> in <s>02304401400014</s> could refer to the stone pine (“holm” [<a>RSV</a> ], “cypress” [<a>NIV</a> ], “plane” [<a>NJPSV</a> ], “fir” [<a>GW</a> ], “oak” [<a>GNB</a> ]). The <i>r-z</i> root betrays a possible relationship to the Hebrew word <i>’erez</i> (“cedar”), and the first Arabic translation of the Bible (in the tenth century <a>A.D.</a>) used the Arabic equivalent of the stone pine.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Because of its seeds, the stone pine has been suggested as a translation for <i>berosh</i> in <s>02801400901028</s> (8), where God likens himself to an evergreen <i>berosh</i> tree. But this is debatable, since the grammar seems to argue that the fruit mentioned there is not the fruit of the speaker (God) but of the addressees: “your fruit” or “their fruit.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>What we see in the various English versions of <s>02304401400014</s> for the translation of <i>tirzah</i> (for example, “holm,” “plane,” “fir,” “oak,” and “cypress”) are only guesses. A reasonable solution then, is to follow the suggestion of Zohary, which at least has some basis in paleobiology and linguistics, and use a transliteration from a major language (for example, <i>pino</i>, <i>payin</i>, and <i>pinyola</i>). In a receptor culture-oriented translation translators could substitute an appropriate tree whose wood is commonly used for carving images, as long as the name is not being used in the translation for some other tree.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>“Pine nuts” from China are now being sold in the United States as a salad ingredient. We assume these to be from a sub-species of the stone pine.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0717_aleppo_pine"/>The stately Aleppo Pine <i>Pinus halepensis</i>, also known as the Jerusalem pine, is native to Israel and Lebanon. It was never abundant in Israel since it grows best in soft, chalky soil, which occurs in relatively few places. In modern times many of these pines have been planted in reserves throughout Israel. The modern Hebrew word for this pine is <i>’oren</i>, which is found in <s>02304101900022</s>. Some versions (for example, <a>NIV</a>) use “pine” there, but Zohary considers that passage to refer to the bay laurel (see <l target="FLORA:1.12">1.12 Laurel (bay tree)</l>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>01100602300016 01100603100016 01100603200008 01100603300018</s> the Hebrew phrase <i>‘ets shemen</i> (literally “oil tree”) is used for the wood used to make the cherubim, the doors, and the doorposts of the Temple. The majority of English versions take this as “wild olive,” in spite of the fact that the olive, both domestic and wild, is notoriously gnarled and knotted and generally unsuited for carpentry work or for carving large-scale images.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01600801500048</s>, which lists four species of trees to be used for making booths, includes both <i>zayith</i> (“olive”) and <i>‘ets shemen</i> (“wild olive”). <a>GNB</a> and <a>NJPSV</a> both use “pine” for <i>‘ets shemen</i> here (<a>GNB</a> reverses the order of the two trees). The phrase “and other leafy trees” suggests some broad-leafed tree rather than a conifer—but pine branches could also have been included for their pleasant smell.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02304101900020</s> contains a list of trees that will be put in the wilderness in the new age. It includes <i>‘ets shemen</i> along with the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Given this evidence, Zohary is convinced that <i>‘ets shemen</i> is the Aleppo pine; this is supported by the fact that pine trees in northern Kurdistan are still called <i>‘ets shemen</i> by the Jews there since the time of the exile. Blenkinsopp (page 292) and other commentators, including the early Jewish commentators Saadiah, Shulchan Aruch and Kimchi, also support the translation of “oil tree” as “pine.” Hepper, however, believes that the cherubim of <s>01100602300016</s> (and the doors and doorposts of verses <s>01100603100016 01100603200008 01100603300018</s>) were made of olive wood. He says that such large objects as the cherubim could have been “composed of numerous small pieces of wood somehow joined together and then carved to the required shape” (page 158). <a>GNB</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>NCV</a>, <a>LB</a>, <a>NAB</a>, <a>NJPSV</a>, and <a>GECL</a> all take this position also, translating <i>‘ets shemen</i> there as “olive.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The writers of <a>FFB</a> take a third position, namely, that <i>‘ets shemen</i> in 1 Kgs 6 refers to the Oleaster <i>Elaeagnus angustifolia</i>, which is sometimes called the wild olive (or Russian olive) although it is no relation to the olive tree. Hepper says that <i>‘ets shemen</i> cannot be the oleaster, since oleaster is not native to Israel. Furthermore, it is too small to provide lumber for furniture or buildings of any size.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Some options for the translation of <i>‘ets shemen</i> are:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. Follow Zohary by transliterating the word for “pine” from a major language (for example, French <i>pin</i>, Spanish <i>pino</i>, Arabic <i>sanawbar</i>, Portuguese <i>pinheiro</i>), or by using the word for the pine trees that are being introduced into many countries by the government. (In parts of southern Nigeria any conifer is called a “Christmas tree,” which is not recommended!)</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. Translate literally by saying “oil tree” as <a>KJV</a> does in <s>02304101900020</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. Follow popular English usage and take the local word for “olive” (first found in <s>00100801101000</s>) and add the word “wild/bush” to distinguish it from the domestic one (following <a>REB</a>). This would conform to <a>FFB</a> ’s suggestion.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>4. Transliterate the word for “olive” from a major language (for example, <i>olivi</i> or <i>wolifu</i>) and add the word “wild/bush.”</Paragraph>

However, the passage in <s>02603100800026</s>, where the plane is used in a metaphorical context, leaves room for local equivalents. Egypt, in this passage, is compared to a mighty cedar, against which other trees, such as the plane and the fir, do not match up. Rendering “plane” here will depend on what the translator does with the other trees.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0730_poplar"/>There are several species of poplar in the Middle East, and that has given rise to some controversy over which one is referred to by a particular Hebrew word. Two kinds of poplar were common in Israel in Bible times, the white poplar and the Euphrates poplar.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>00103003700012</s> Jacob’s magical recipe for multiplying sheep and goats relied on the light inner wood of the White Poplar <i>Populus alba</i>, a tree that grows along riverbanks in Israel. This softwood tree with gray bark was used for timber and for making tools and rafters. In some places the bark is used as medicine.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Euphrates Poplar <i>Populus euphratica</i> likewise grows along riverbanks, but it is much more widespread in the Middle East than the white poplar, and that makes it a natural candidate for the reference in <s>01913700200004</s>, which says “On the <i>‘aravim</i> [‘willows’ in <a>RSV</a> ] there we hung up our lyres.” This is further strengthened by the fact that in Iraq this poplar is called <i>gharab</i>, which is cognate with <i>‘aravah</i>. Zohary suggests that the Hebrew word <i>tsaftsafah</i> in <s>02601700501032</s> could be taken to refer to the Euphrates poplar. Hepper supports that, citing the easy-rooting properties of the poplar. However, the Arabs call the willow <i>safsaf</i>, and for that reason we take the Ezekiel reference as referring to the willow.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The trees mentioned in <s>01000502300036 01000502400026</s> and in <s>01301401400048 01301401500024</s> may possibly have been poplars (“balsam trees” in <a>RSV</a>; “mulberry trees” in <a>KJV</a>; “aspens” in <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a>), based on the observation that the leaves of poplars make a rustling sound when the wind blows.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Note that in <s>02800401301028</s>, the Hebrew word <i>livneh</i> refers to the styrax (see <l target="FLORA:1.22">1.22 Styrax</l>), the argument being that it is associated there with the oak and terebinth.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0731_poplar_leaf"/>The white poplar is a tall tree reaching perhaps 20 meters (66 feet). Its seeds are dispersed by the wind in bunches of long, silky hair. The Euphrates poplar is also tall. It has two types of leaves. When young, it produces a narrow leaf like a willow; when it matures, its leaves are broader. This has led to some confusion among scholars as to the identity of willows and poplars mentioned in the Bible.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0732_poplar_trunk"/><i>Populus</i> species (cottonwood, aspen) are known throughout Europe and North America. In Africa, apart from North Africa and South Africa where a number of kinds of poplars have been introduced from Europe, there do not seem to be any <i>Populus</i> species. However, Palgrave notes that a related species, the Wild Willow <i>Salix subserrata</i>, is distributed from Egypt and Sudan right down through Kenya, Uganda, Zaire, and into South Africa. In Asia <i>Populus</i> species are known from Arabia to the region of the Himalayas.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Where <i>Populus</i> species are known, and if the inner bark is known to be white, they could be used in Genesis, but keep in mind that another tree of the same family (willow) is mentioned in <s>00302304000038</s>. Where <i>Populus</i> species are not known, we advocate transliterating from a major language in <s>00103003700012</s> (for example, <i>popula</i>, <i>populari</i>, <i>hawur</i> [Arabic], or <i>abele</i> [French]), since this is a historical setting rather than a rhetorical one. We would avoid making local substitutions, even though <i>A Handbook on Genesis</i> (pages 701–702) sanctions it there.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0786_sandalwood"/>A survey of the English versions indicates the vigorous debate, if not confusion, surrounding the Hebrew word <i>’almug</i> in 1 Kings and its parallel <i>’algum</i> in 2 Chronicles. The majority of English versions (<a>RSV</a>, <a>NRSV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>REB</a>, <a>NJB</a>) transliterate directly from the Hebrew in both books, but <a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, and <a>NCV</a> harmonize 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles by using “juniper” throughout. <a>GECL</a> likewise avoids the issue by translating “precious wood” in both books. The debate hinges on two questions:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. Is <i>’almug</i> in 1 Kings the same as <i>’algum</i> in 2 Chronicles?</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. Where does the <i>’almug</i> /<i>’algum</i> tree come from?</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Note where they are said to come from: <s>01101001100028</s>, <i>’almug</i> from Ophir; <s>01400200700016</s>, <i>’algum</i> from Lebanon; <s>01400901000032</s>, <i>’algum</i> from Ophir.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The botanical commentators stand as follows: Zohary, following Tristram, says that the trees are the same, that is, red sandalwood (<i>Pterocarpus santolinus</i>, also called red saunders) from India (via Ophir). Hepper, following Moldenke, Celsius, W. Smith and others, says the trees are different: <i>’almug</i> is the red sandalwood; <i>’algum</i> is the Grecian Juniper <i>Juniperus excelsa</i> of Lebanon.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>According to <a>FFB</a>, the trees are the same, of unknown origin but maybe the red sandalwood, the white sandalwood, or the Phoenician juniper.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The biblical commentators Keil and Delitzsch consider the trees to be the same, namely sandalwood. According to them, in <s>01400200801000</s> the writer mistakenly groups <i>’algum</i> with cedar and cypress as products of Lebanon, whereas <i>’algum</i> should stand separately with “precious stones,” as it does in <s>01400901000032</s>. Furthermore, G. H. Jones argues it should be <i>’almug</i>, not <i>’algum</i>, on the basis of cognates in Ugaritic (<i>’-l-m-g</i>) and Akkadian (<i>elammakku</i>). Furthermore, a dialect of Sanskrit has the word <i>mocha</i> for the sandalwood tree (see also the appendix below). Adding the Arabic definite article <i>al</i> could explain <i>al-mug</i> (and Arabic typically changes <i>o</i> to <i>u</i> in loan words). Greenfield and Mayrhofer (1967, quoted in Hepper) also hold on philological grounds that <i>’algum</i> and <i>’almug</i> are the same thing; they identify it with a tree from Lebanon which they do not name. Ugaritic records, incidentally, refer to a tree called <i>’-l-m-g</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>On a quite different track, Hareuveni (page 99) tries to make a case for translating <i>’almug</i> as “coral,” a mineral product found in the sea, on the ground that <i>’almog</i> is the modern Hebrew word for coral. It makes a good pair with “precious stones.” Hareuveni quotes the Babylonian Talmud, which describes in detail how these “coral trees” are brought up from the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The translators of <a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a> and <a>NCV</a> (following <a>FFB</a>, which follows Koehler and Baumgartner) hold that the phrase “<i>’algum</i> from Lebanon” in <s>01400200700016</s> is basic and that it must refer to the Phoenician juniper (see <l target="FLORA:1.11.2">1.11.2 Phoenician juniper (coastal juniper)</l>). Then they harmonize 1 Kings with 2 Chronicles.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Looking at the accounts in 1 Kgs 10 and 2 Chr 9 as stories about Hiram’s contribution to King Solomon, one may observe first of all that the accounts are both awkwardly interrupted by the story of the visit of the queen of Sheba.* They are almost word-for-word parallels except for the <i>’almug</i> /<i>’algum</i> difference. King Hiram brought gold from Ophir, and also, incidentally, <i>’algum</i> /<i>’almug</i> wood and precious stones. 1 Kings refers to <i>’almug</i> three times; the parallel account in 2 Chronicles mentions <i>’algum</i> twice, with the third parallel clearly implied. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that they refer to the same product, and that the variation is caused by the simple inversion of the two Hebrew consonants <i>mem</i> and <i>gimel</i> in one account. Neither account says where the wood came from, but it seems not to be Lebanon. This seems to rule out “juniper” (as in <a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, and <a>NCV</a>). And it may not be Ophir. Which of the two readings is earlier? It is generally accepted that the Kings account came first and that the Chronicler used the Deuteronomic Kings account (with <i>’almug</i>) as a reference. Let us assume that <i>’almug</i> is prior.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Note that <s>01400200700016</s> (8) expresses King Solomon’s desire that King Hiram send him “cedar, cypress and <i>’algum</i>.” There is no exact parallel to this in 1 Kings, but in <s>01100500701000 01100500801000 01100500901000</s> we have King Hiram’s response to Solomon’s request. He says that he will send Solomon cedar and cypress. There is no reference to any other type of wood. But when we get to <s>01400901000032</s> we find that Hiram sends algum wood and precious stones. We can conclude that <i>’algum</i> was added to <s>01400200700008</s> in order to anticipate the statement in <s>01400901000032</s> (and <s>01101001100028</s>) that Solomon brought <i>’algum</i> wood for use in the Temple. Unfortunately, the way it was added makes it sound as though the precious wood is from Lebanon. <s>01400801801000</s> and <s>01400901001000</s> (interrupted by the queen of Sheba story) clearly separate the gold (from Ophir) from the algum and precious stones (origin unspecified). We conclude that, in adapting the text of <s>01101001100028 01101001200016</s>, the scribe preparing <s>01400901000032 01400901100016</s> inverted the consonants, yielding <i>’algum</i>, and the other reference in 2 Chronicles was adapted to harmonize with the first.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0787_sandalwood_leaf"/>If the translator is convinced on the basis of the cognates that the sandalwood tree is intended in both 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles, as we propose, it is worthwhile noting that many species of sandalwood (<i>Pterocarpus</i>) occur all over the world. There are twenty tropical species (some known as padouk, vermilion wood, bloodwood, and kino). In Africa species of <i>Pterocarpus</i> are called rosewood, barwood, or kino. In Asia the <i>Pterocarpus</i> species may be called Burmese rosewood, red wood, Amboyna wood, or maidu. French-speaking areas may know it as <i>santal rouge</i>; in Portuguese it is <i>sandalo vermelho</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Translation options are:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. Use a relative of the sandalwood present in the local area, or transliterate from a major language.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. Take 1 Kings as “original” and use a transliteration of <i>mug</i> /<i>mok</i> or <i>almug</i> /<i>almok</i> in both books. <s>01400200700016</s> could then have a footnote explaining that the Hebrew has <i>’algum</i>. (A study Bible would explain why this tropical tree came to be in this verse about Lebanon.)</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. Generalize by using “precious wood” in both books as in <a>GECL</a>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>4. Transliterate from the Hebrew in both 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles as in <a>RSV</a> and <a>NIV</a>, live with the tantalizing similarity (for example, <i>aligumu</i> /<i>alimugu</i>), and wait for archeologists to discover samples at the Temple Mount.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Zohary suggests that <s>01400200700016</s> a be revised to read “Send me also cedar [and] cypress from Lebanon and [also] algum timber.” This matches better with 1 Kings but may be a more radical rearrangement of the grammar than some translators will allow.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Zohary and others have argued for <i>’almug</i> being sandalwood on the grounds that <i>mug</i> is cognate with the Sanskrit <i>mocha</i>, with the definite article <i>al</i> prefixed. This assumes that the Arabs were trafficking in sandalwood, using the name <i>almuka</i> or something like it, and that the Arabic word came into the Hebrew Bible at the time of the writing of 1–2 Kings and 1–2 Chronicles. There is a question, however, whether the definite article was in use in Arabic at the time these books were written. Moscati’s <i>An Introduction to the Comparative Grammar of the Semitic Languages</i> says that most texts of Epigraphic South Arabian and Early Northern Arabic (fifth century <a>B.C.</a> to fourth century <a>A.D.</a>) have no definite article, but instead suffix a <i>nun</i> or <i>mem</i> for the absolute state (as in Babylonian). It has been assumed until recently that the article <i>al</i> appears regularly only in classical Arabic (beginning in the fourth century <a>A.D.</a> onward). However, two important exceptions with <i>al</i> have been found, in the form of inscriptions, and Moscati concedes that they may date to the Early Northern Arabic Period. Further, Herodotus, writing in the fifth century <a>B.C.</a>, already uses a phrase for “the goddess” with both of the prefixes <i>h</i> /<i>hn</i> and <i>al</i> in an Aramaic inscription.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0840_styrax"/>The <i>livneh</i> tree mentioned along with the oak (<i>’allon</i>) and the terebinth (<i>’elah</i>) in Hosea’s account of Israel’s idolatry has traditionally been identified as the poplar, on the basis of its occurrence in <s>00103003700012</s>. However, as Zohary observes, it is likely that the Hebrew word <i>livneh</i> actually refers to two different white trees and should be translated according to the context. In Hosea the geographical context is the oak and terebinth forests of the Judean hills. Here <i>livneh</i> most likely refers to the Styrax <i>Styrax officinalis</i>, whereas the same word <i>livneh</i> in <s>00103003700012</s> (Jacob’s goat-breeding scheme) probably refers to the White Poplar <i>Populus alba</i> (see <l target="FLORA:1.20">1.20 Poplar</l>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0841_styrax_leaf"/>The styrax is a deciduous shrub or tree 3–6 meters (10–20 feet) tall with big leaves that look whitish from a distance because of the silvery hairs on the underside of the leaves. (Note that the Arabic cognates <i>lavan</i> and <i>livna</i> mean “white” or “bright.”) The flowers are white, and fishermen sometimes throw the poisonous seeds into streams to stun and catch fish.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There has been considerable debate and confusion over the names “styrax” and “storax.” Following Zohary, we are suggesting that “storax” be reserved for the resin of the gumbearing shrub liquidambar of the Arabian Peninsula (see <l target="FLORA:4.2.4">4.2.4 Opobalsamum (balsam, balm)</l>), and “styrax” be used only when referring to the shrub <i>Styrax officinalis</i> of the Palestinian hills. Although some kinds of styrax produce aromatic resin, this one does not, according to Zohary.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>There are 120 kinds of styrax found in the Mediterranean area, Southeast Asia, and tropical America. Many of them are known for their aromatic resin used in medicine (benzoin) and incense.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The treatment of styrax in <s>02800401300028</s> will depend on what the translators have done with oak and terebinth. If the others have been transliterated, it is likely that the same would be done with styrax, yielding <i>sitirak</i>, <i>suturak</i>, or <i>libine</i> /<i>labani</i> (following Arabic). However, one could also argue for a functional equivalent, namely a local tree associated with the worship of spirits. A footnote could be used to give the probable botanical identification.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0855_tamarisk"/>There are two main species of tamarisk referred to in the Bible, the Leafless Tamarisk <i>Tamarix aphylla</i> and the much more common Nile Tamarisk <i>Tamarix nilotica</i>. Both species are found throughout the plains and in the wadis (dry stream beds) of the Aravah and the Negev, where they tap water that has soaked into the ground after flash floods. Tamarisks can grow in salty soil, earning them the name “salt cedar” in some places. A third species grows only in the Jordan Valley. None of them has proper leaves but rather fleshy twigs, which are eaten by goats and sheep. Despite a similarity in name, tamarinds (<i>Tamarindus indica</i>) are not related to tamarisks.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the account of the burial of Saul we have a mismatch between <s>00903101300018</s>, which says he was buried uner an <i>’eshel</i> (“tamarisk” in <a>RSV</a>), and <s>01301001201048</s>, which says he was buried under an <i>’elah</i> (“oak” in <a>RSV</a>). So what was it? Maybe neither!</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>At some point in the development of Hebrew, the word <i>’eshel</i> became a general term for trees. However, the words <i>’allon</i> (“oak”) and <i>’elah</i> (“terebinth”) also generalized in post-biblical Hebrew to <i>’ilan</i>, meaning “tree,” so it is possible that at some point in the editing of 1 Chronicles, <i>’elah</i> as a generic word replaced the earlier <i>’eshel</i>, which itself could have already been generic at that point. That is, both words could have been regional, stylistic, or in-vogue variations of the general word for “tree.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0126_tamarisk_cypress_trees"/>The leafless tamarisk grows to a height of 10 meters (33 feet) and can be 1 meter (3 feet) across at the base. The more common Nile tamarisk is smaller and is really a shrub, branching right from the ground. Tamarisks grow in very dry places due to the fact that their roots extend far into the ground. A specimen in Iraq was found to have roots extending 11 meters (36 feet) below the surface (Hepper, page 53). Both species have a broad crown. The trunk is often twisted. The cedar-like branches hang down like those of the weeping willow. Bedouin shepherds have planted many of them throughout the Negev for their flocks.</Paragraph>

According to Zohary, the “cedar” branches mentioned in the cleansing rituals of <s>00301400401032</s> and <s>00401900601012</s> may possibly have been from tamarisks, although Phoenician juniper trees (very similar to cedar) were also available in some places on the journey of the wandering Israelites. Imported into the western United States, tamarisks have multiplied so fast in stream beds that they are now considered a costly nuisance. In some places they are used in making dyes and in processing leather.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Tamarisks are found plentifully in Asia (forty species) and Europe (fourteen species), with a few also in Africa in the Mediterranean basin. The English versions are virtually unanimous in translating <i>’eshel</i> as “tamarisk.” <a>CEV</a> uses “tamarisk” with a footnote: “A tall shade tree that has deep roots and needs little water.” The options for translating “tamarisk” are:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. Transliterate from a major language, for example, <i>tamarisiki</i>, <i>tamaris</i>, <i>esheli</i> (Hebrew), or <i>eteli</i> /<i>atali</i> (Arabic).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. Consider the function of the tree, which in Genesis was almost certainly connected to Abraham’s worship of God, and translate as “holy tree” perhaps with a footnote giving the Hebrew and/or English, especially if you have used “holy tree” in <s>00101200601000</s> for “oak.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. Simply use “tree” with a footnote stating that the Hebrew specifies <i>’eshel</i>, that is, tamarisk.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0864_terebinth"/>The Hebrew words <i>’elah</i> and <i>’alah</i> refer to any of three species of terebinth mentioned in the Bible: 1) the Atlantic Terebinth <i>Pistacia atlantica</i>, 2) the Palestinian Terebinth <i>Pistacia palaestina</i> (or <i>Pistacia terebinthus</i>), and 3) the Lentisk Terebinth <i>Pistacia lentiscus</i> (or <i>Pistacia lenticus</i>), also called the mastic tree.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>According to Zohary, the Atlantic terebinth, also called the teil tree, is found in the Negev, Lower Galilee, and the Dan Valley. Hepper says it was once abundant in Gilead, the trunk and bark being a possible source for aromatic resin (mastic) exported to Egypt. It is a dry-land tree that grows in the border areas between evergreen woodlands and the dwarf-shrub steppes (note “valley of Elah” in <s>00901700200024 00901701900024 00902101000028</s>). The nuts of the Atlantic terebinth are used for dyeing and tanning animal skins, but they can be eaten if roasted. They are often sold in Arab markets, are bigger than the nuts of the Palestinian terebinth, and are quite different from the true pistachio nuts, which come from outside the Holy Land (see below).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0128_terebinth_branch"/>The Palestinian terebinth is found mostly on wooded hills, often together with the common oak. Its little round nuts can be eaten whole, fresh, or roasted, and it is probably these nuts (<i>boten</i>) that were carried to Egypt by the sons of Jacob (<s>00104301100064</s>), although Zohary holds that they could also have been the fruit of the true pistachio tree (<i>Pistacia vera</i>), which was, and is, abundant in Persia (now Iran).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The lentisk terebinth is a shrub or bush that grew in the hills of Gilead, and may be the source of the “balm/resin” (<i>tsori</i> in Hebrew) carried by the Ishmaelites in <s>00103702500046</s>, and by the sons of Jacob to Egypt along with pistachio nuts in <s>00104301100064</s>. The fact that <s>00103702500046 02400802200004 02404601100010</s> all mention Gilead in connection with the resin <i>tsori</i>, suggests that its source was a plant unique to Palestine. That is why it could be used to trade for goods from Egypt. The references in Jeremiah presumably refer to the salve made from the terebinth resin.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Terebinths look like oaks but have pinnate leaves. The Atlantic terebinth may reach a height of 10 meters (33 feet). The Palestinian terebinth species is shorter, reaching to 5 meters (17 feet). The lentisk terebinth, or mastic (gum) tree, is a small shrub or tree 1–3 meters (3–10 feet) in height that produces a sweet-smelling resin when the stem or branches are cut. The resin dries into hard lumps, which are then ground and dissolved in olive oil for medicinal use, perfume, incense, varnish, and glue.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0876_thyine"/>The Thyine tree <i>Tetraclinis articulata</i> is also called “thuja” or “thuya,” and, confusingly, “citron” or “citrus” in different parts of the world. Similar to the well-known arborvitae, the thyine is found mainly in the Mediterranean area and across North Africa (Morocco, Algeria). It is a coniferous tree related to cypresses, pines, and cedars. Its identification in the book of Revelation is based on the Greek spelling, <i>thuinos</i>. In some places it is called the sandarac tree on the basis of the clear varnish (sandarac) that is made from the resin. The Romans, who used the wood for cabinet work, called it “citrus” for some strange reason, though apart from the yellow fruit, it bears no resemblance to true citrus trees.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0918_willow_tree"/>There are two kinds of willow in Palestine, the White Willow <i>Salix alba</i> being the northern one, and the Common Willow <i>Salix acmophylla</i> being the southern, more heat-tolerant one. In the Jordan Valley the willow gives way to the salt-tolerant Euphrates poplar as the river gets close to the Dead Sea. Some confusion of names arises from the fact that the Euphrates poplar has two kinds of leaves. The younger shoots produce a narrow leaf like the willow, and the mature shoots produce a wider, ovate leaf.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Zohary states confidently that the species in <s>00302304000038</s> and <s>02304400400014</s> is definitely the willow. Presumably the same Hebrew word <i>‘aravah</i> in <s>01804002200010</s> also refers to the willow. Hepper, translating this word as “willows” in <s>02304400400014</s>, apparently agrees with Zohary. <a>FFB</a> concedes that putting “willows” in <s>00302304000038</s> may be correct, but goes on to reverse itself by saying that “poplar” is justified in all passages by the fact that the Arabic name <i>gharab</i> is cognate with the Hebrew word. In response, Zohary argues that Arabs use <i>gharab</i> for both poplars and willows, the leaves of the two trees being very similar.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Considering the context, the word <i>‘aravah</i> found in <s>01913700200004</s> most likely refers to the Euphrates poplar (see <l target="FLORA:1.20">1.20 Poplar</l>). Ezekiel’s reference to a plant (<i>tsaftsafah</i> in Hebrew) that grew by a stream could refer either to a poplar or to a willow. According to Zohary, Arabs in Egypt call willows <i>safsaf</i>, whereas elsewhere in North Africa <i>safsaf</i> refers to the Euphrates poplar.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>If “willow” is indeed the correct translation of <i>‘aravah</i> in Leviticus, then it is one of the four species recommended for use in building shelters for the Festival of Shelters. In Job it is the habitat of the mysterious Behemoth that no man can tame. In Isaiah and Ezekiel it is a metaphor for something that grows luxuriantly.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The English versions fall into several groups regarding the translation of <i>‘aravah</i> in <s>00302304000038</s>: 1) ”willows” (<a>RSV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, <a>REB</a>, <a>NASB</a>, <a>NJPSV</a>); 2) ”poplars” (<a>NIV</a>, <a>NCV</a>, <a>GW</a>, <a>NAB</a>); 3) ”flowering shrubs” (<a>NJB</a>); and 4) ”leafy trees/branches” (<a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>; <a>GNB</a> combines the last two of the series, <a>CEV</a> the last three).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>As explained above, we recommend “willow” or a member of the <i>Salix</i> genus in <s>00302304000038 01804002200010 02304400400014</s>. Over three hundred <i>Salix</i> species are found around the world in temperate regions. They are sometimes known as ossiers or sallows. At least one <i>Salix</i> species (Safsaf Willow <i>Salix subserrata</i>) is found in sub-Saharan Africa in addition to being found in Egypt, Libya, and Israel. <i>Flora of West Tropical Africa</i> lists three other species, and Palgrave records two other indigenous willows in southern Africa. There are willows on the Jos Plateau in Nigeria (Hepper, private communication). People who make round, thatched houses use thin, flexible sticks from a shrub to form the concentric rings that hold the radial sticks (either bamboo or sorghum stalks) in place. Some of these may be willows, and if so, the local word would be appropriate in the biblical context where shelters are being constructed.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Where such a local plant is not available, we favor following something like “tree of <i>wilo</i> ” or using a generic phrase, lumping it with the previous phrase, but making sure that <i>wilo</i> or its equivalent in a major language is included in a footnote.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>02304400400014</s> and <s>02601700500032</s> the willow is symbolic of quick growth and may require an appropriate local equivalent of a thriving plant.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The twenty-seven wilderness trees and shrubs considered in Chapter 1 were known and used by people in Bible times but not cultivated. We now turn to trees and shrubs that were cultivated. In some cases it is difficult to know when a particular species was actually domesticated, since the process took place over centuries and much of it happened outside our area of study. Date palms, olives, and figs were probably cultivated quite early, as they could be grown from cuttings. Thirteen domestic trees are mentioned in the Bible, although in some cases, such as apple, carob, pistachio, citron and walnut, there is much debate about their identity in a particular passage. In any case, the species mentioned here were unquestionably grown in Israel in Bible times.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Despite its importance to the survival of human beings, agriculture in the Near East has devastated the original vegetation. Humans, with their tools (including fire) and grazing animals, have decimated the forest and other plant life to the point where almost none of it survives except in protected areas. Even the desert has been damaged by the removal of shrubs, leaving the slopes to be eroded down to the bare rock.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>On the other hand, the vegetation of the land—both wild and cultivated—has also had a profound effect on the human beings who lived there. At the time of the conquest of Canaan, the scouts discovered a “land flowing with milk and honey.” They brought back with them figs and pomegranates and a cluster of grapes so huge it took two of them to carry it on a pole between them. When the conquest finally took place, the newcomers took over a well-developed agriculture that they then developed to a higher level, bringing in plants from Egypt, Arabia, Persia, and other countries.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The effect of agriculture, and particularly of trees, was not just a matter of producing food. The vocabulary of agriculture saturates the language and literature of the Holy Land. Apart from the emotional associations carried by trees such as cedars, oaks, palms, olives and vines, the images of seed, fruit, flower, root, and harvest occur as metaphors over and over in the language of the prophets and in the Wisdom literature, right through to the teachings of Jesus and his followers.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Regarding the translation of names for cultivated trees, our general strategy is that when a tree or shrub is used rhetorically, that is, as a metaphor or simile, then the focus is on the <i>quality</i> of the tree or shrub, not on the botanical details. In that case the translator is urged to find a cultural equivalent carrying that same quality. When the passage is not rhetorical, the translator is compelled by the historicity of the passage to find a botanically related species. When that is not available, it becomes necessary to use a transliteration from a major international language, seek a generic word, or use a descriptive phrase. There is a loss in that, of course. Translation is a matter of balancing losses and gains.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>We are including the carob and citron here even though they could as well be treated under “1 Wild Trees and Shrubs.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0002_almond_flower"/>The almond is one of a group of fruit-bearing trees (<i>Prunus</i>) that also includes plums, cherries, peaches, and apricots. There are fifteen species of wild almond in Iran, two wild species in Israel, and one cultivated one (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>, also called <i>Amygdalus communis</i>). They are plentiful now in the hills of Israel, and probably were so in Bible times, even in the hot, dry Negev.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The almond tree grows to around 4 meters (13 feet) tall. It loses its leaves in winter and then, before the new leaves appear in spring, a profusion of white or pink flowers appears. The flowers are quite flat, with oval petals. The fuzzy fruit, about the size of a date palm fruit, comes about ten weeks later. The seed (“nut” in English) is fifty percent oil, and can be eaten raw but is usually roasted.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Three passages make reference to physical features of the almond tree.

The flat almond flower made a reasonable model for the lamp holders at the top of the branches of the lampstand in the Tabernacle.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0022_almondtree"/>The writer of <s>02101200500026</s> uses the profusion of white blossoms on the almond tree as a symbol of old age. The comparison is of course to the white hair of the elders. <a>FFB</a> ’s comment that the almond tree is “a sign of the beauty of spring which does not bring joy to an old man” (page 89) ignores the gift of the poet.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>02400101100030</s> the author makes use of the similarity of the Hebrew name <i>shaqed</i> (“almond”) to the word <i>shoqed</i> (“watching” or “wakeful”) to emphasize that Yahweh is “watching” over Israel. Some commentators add to this that since the almond is the first of the trees to blossom in the spring—even before the leaves emerge—it was “waking up early,” and God, likewise, is an “early help” in time of trouble.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Places named “Luz” in <s>00102801901024 00103500601008 00104800301022 00601600201010 00601801301014 00601801301020 00700102301026 00700102601028</s> indicate the value of almonds to the people of the land and the possibility that almond trees grew in the desert hills of Sinai, although they are not found there today.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0021_almond"/>The <i>Prunus</i> family has members in various parts of the world, such as <i>Prunus salicina</i> in China and <i>Prunus munsoniana</i> in eastern North America. However, the branches and fruit of many of these are so different from the true almond that in nonfigurative passages local names will not really be usable. In a passage such as <s>00103003700018</s>, a transliteration from a major language is recommended; for example, <i>shaked</i> /<i>lus</i> (Hebrew), <i>lawus</i> (Arabic), <i>amande</i> (French), <i>amendoa</i> (Portuguese), <i>almendra</i> (Spanish), and <i>alimondi</i>. In English the “l” is not pronounced, so “almond” may be transliterated <i>amond</i>. Elsewhere, where the tree is used figuratively, as in Exodus and Ecclesiastes (see below), translators can use a blossom with a similar shape and color.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In most translations the words <i>shaqed</i> and <i>luz</i> will need to be translated contextually, as follows:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00104301100068</s>: Jacob gifts to Pharaoh were “a little balm and a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.” Most translators will have to use the phrase “almond fruit” or “almond seeds” here.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00202503300006 00202503300006 00202503400014</s>: The shape of the flower is in focus here (<a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>REB</a>, and others have “almond blossoms”). It has five petals that form a roughly cup-like shape.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00401702300056</s>: Since Aaron’s rod produced almond fruit in verse 8 (23), it is reasonable to assume that the sticks in verse 2 (17) are from almond trees. In some languages it may be useful for cohesion to make this explicit in the text at verse 2.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02101200500026</s>: Here the almond tree serves as a metaphor for old age. A transliteration of “almond” from English or some other major language will fall flat in terms of poetic impact. <a>Mft</a> is the only translation that I have seen that attempts to retain the tree and the image by rendering the third clause of this verse as “when his hair is almond white.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02400101100030</s>: As mentioned above, here we have a word play on <i>shaqed</i> /<i>shoqed</i> “almond/watching.” Again, a few translations have made valiant attempts to translate the wordplay; for example, <a>Mft</a> renders the last clause of this verse as “The shoot of a wake-tree” and <a>NJB</a> has “I see a branch of the Watchful Tree.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0006_appletree"/>The Wild Apple (or Crab Apple) <i>Malus sylvestris</i> is the ancestor of the sweet fruit we know today <i>Malus domestica</i>. The domestication may have occurred in what is now Iran, Armenia, Turkey, or Syria. Apples have grown in Europe, in western Asia, and probably in Turkey and Lebanon, for several thousand years. The question for Bible scholars is whether the puny, rather tart fruit of the wild apple merits the glowing description we find in <s>02002501100002</s>: “… like apples of silver in a setting of gold,” and in <s>02200200500016</s>: “Sustain me with raisins, refresh me with apples; for I am sick with love.” With that doubt in mind, some scholars have suggested that the <i>tapuach</i>, whose pleasant smell is noted in <s>02200700900042</s> (8), is the apricot. Zohary favors the apple on linguistic grounds, citing the Arabic cognate <i>tuffach</i>, which refers to the apple, and Egyptian records from 1298–1235 <a>B.C.</a> that refer to <i>taph</i> (probably the same as <i>tapuach</i>) growing in the Nile Valley. It is possible that improved varieties had already been developed in biblical times. Zohary points out that the apricot appeared in the region much later than the apple.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Hepper cites a study that describes how archeologists found carbonized wild apple fruits, dating from the ninth century <a>B.C.</a>, in an excavation of Kadesh Barnea in northern Sinai, but he concludes that the issue of apple versus apricot is irresolvable at the present time.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Apples grow well only in temperate climates where the tree is frozen part of the year, so there are no close native relatives in tropical Africa or Asia. However, fruits grown in Europe and South Africa are being shipped to many African countries, and so have become well-known, at least in the cities, usually by a name from a major international language. We recommend transliteration from a well-known language (for example, <i>tufa</i> [Arabic], <i>pom</i> /<i>pomier</i> [French], <i>manzano</i> [Spanish], <i>masa</i> /<i>masiyera</i> [Portuguese], and <i>apel</i> [English]), although translators seeking literary equivalence may wish to find a cultural substitute in the Proverbs and Song of Songs passages. For example, in <s>02200200300004</s> (“Like the <i>tapuach</i> among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among men”), a local idealized tree could be substituted if there is one. A footnote would cite the Hebrew and its major language equivalent. “Apricot” in <a>NEB</a> has been replaced by “apple” in <a>REB</a>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0110_carob"/>The Carob <i>Ceratonia siliqua</i> is a very common tree found throughout the Mediterranean area and also in Arabia, Somalia, and Oman. It is native to Israel, where it was called <i>charuv</i>, according to Jewish religious writings of the first few centuries after Christ. Arabs call it <i>kharrub</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In Bible times, as now, carob trees were found in the coastal plain and in the foothills (Shephelah) and on the eastern slopes of Galilee and Samaria. The carob seed pods are filled with a sweet moist pulp that was popular with poor people. The pods were also used to feed animals. That is probably the basis for Jesus’ statement that the prodigal boy in the parable looked hungrily at the carob <i>keration</i> (“pods”) that he had to feed to the pigs (<s>04201501600012</s>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The carob tree is an evergreen with dark green leaves and many low leafy branches that hide a short trunk. The crown of the tree is round and may reach as high as 12 meters (40 feet). As is the case of the acacia, the date palm and the fig, the carob tree is a lonely representative of a large tropical family (in this case the pea sub-family <i>Caesalpinioideae</i>) that found its way into parts of Israel many millennia ago. The trees in this family are legumes, that is, they put nitrogen into the soil by way of little nodules on the roots. As the tree ages, the trunk becomes twisted. In contrast to many other trees of the Bible lands, this one bears flowers in autumn, and the seed pods form the following summer. The mature pod is dark brown and about 15–25 centimeters (6–10 inches) in length and 2.5–3.5 centimeters (1–1.5 inches) broad.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0111_carobpod"/>If indeed the “pods” of <s>04201501600012</s> were carob pods, it would certainly indicate that they were not considered high-class food. The tree is also called “St. John’s bread” on the belief that John the Baptist must have eaten these fruits when he lived in the desert of Judea. It is quite likely that John did eat carob pods. However, the suggestion that the “locusts” in <s>04100100601034</s> were locust bean pods is not correct, since John probably did eat locusts, as some people in the world still do today. Ironically, carob pod pulp, which was once the “food of the poor” has become, in the last few years, an expensive “health food” in England and America! The word “carat” used in weighing diamonds comes from the Greek name of this tree, since the seeds were used as a standard for measurement. They typically weigh about two hundred milligrams.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Since the Greek word for carob does not actually occur in <s>04201501600012</s>, and <i>keration</i> could possibly refer to some other sort of pods, we cannot actually name a species here. If translators have a word for the edible seed pods of trees, they should use it. Otherwise they will have to use something like “fruit of wild trees.” In study notes translators may wish to refer to major language terms, for example, French <i>caroube</i>, Spanish <i>algarrobo</i>, Portuguese <i>alfarroba</i>, and Arabic <i>kharrub</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Mosaic instructions for celebrating the Festival of Shelters mentioned in <s>00302304000020</s> include the Hebrew words <i>‘ets hadar</i>, often translated as “goodly tree.” The word <i>hadar</i>, however, could be the name of a specific tree (note the similarity to “cedar” in English and <i>cedro</i> in Italian). Some botanists (Moldenke and Goor, for example) hold that the Citron <i>Citrus medica</i> (now called <i>etrog</i> in modern Hebrew) was introduced into the Middle East in ancient times. Excavations in Mesopotamia have revealed citron seeds going back to 4000 <a>B.C.</a>, and a Jewish coin made in 136 <a>B.C.</a> shows a picture of the citron on one side. Some say that Nehemiah and others brought the tree to Israel from Babylonia on their return from exile. Nehemiah’s instructions for celebrating the Festival of Shelters (<s>01600801501000</s>) only mention going out “to the hills” to collect various branches for the construction. He doesn’t mention fruit. So probably <i>‘ets hadar</i> is a generic phrase. No English version that I know of uses “citron” in Leviticus. <a>NLT</a>, however, uses “citrus trees” (with a footnote saying “or ‘majestic trees’”), and <a>NJPSV</a> transliterates, saying “hadar trees.” Many commentators, such as Keil and Delitzsch, believe that the phrase does not refer to a specific tree but is a generic expression introducing the others in the list. Both Zohary and Hepper likewise cast some doubt on the interpretation of <i>hadar</i> as citron, but both include it in their discussion as possible, in deference to Jewish tradition.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0135_citron"/>The citron tree is a type of citrus that grows naturally to about 4 meters (13 feet), with dark evergreen leaves, thorns, and fragrant white flowers. The fruit, like that of the lemon tree, is yellow and very sour. Citron trees are raised commercially in many parts of the world. The prepared peelings are (mostly) shipped to Europe and America to flavor cakes. In Japan and China people value the fragrant smell of the citron. An oil can be distilled from the peels and used in perfumes. Citron fruit was also used in ancient times to treat sicknesses, and it is used medicinally up to the present day in Southeast Asia and South America. Today Jews in Israel carefully prune citron trees to keep them only about 70 centimeters (2 feet) tall, and protect the fruits from any damage so that they are perfect for use in the Festival of Shelters.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>If the translator decides that the Hebrew expression <i>peri ‘ets hadar</i> is a generic phrase in <s>00302304000020</s>, there is still a decision to make because of the structural ambiguity of the phrase in context: is it “the fruit of the good tree X” or “the good fruit of tree X?” <a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>NCV</a>, and <a>GW</a> take <i>hadar</i> (“good”) to modify <i>peri</i> (“fruit”), whereas <a>REB</a> and <a>NJPSV</a> take <i>hadar</i> to modify <i>‘ets</i> (“tree”).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>For those who wish to follow the Jewish tradition and <a>NLT</a>, citron trees are known throughout the tropical world in many kinds, and many languages have borrowed a generic word for them, with modification for the particular species; for example, <i>lemo</i> or <i>lemuno</i> (English), <i>cedrat</i> (French), <i>cidra</i> or <i>poncil</i> (Spanish), <i>cidrão</i> (Portuguese), <i>cedro</i> /<i>cedrone</i> (Italian), <i>cedratzitrone</i> or <i>cederappel</i> (German), and <i>citroen</i> (Dutch). In India it may be called <i>beg-poora</i>; in China, <i>kou-yuan</i>; in Malaya, <i>limau susu</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0026_date_palm"/>More than forty types of date palm (<i>Phoenix dactylifera</i>) are found in dry tropical countries all the way from the Canary Islands, across Africa to India. They probably originated in the Middle East (Zohary and Hopf), where they are still found in abundance. In <s>00302304000026</s> we read that the branches of date palms were to be used for the Festival of Shelters, and in <s>04301201300010</s> people welcomed Jesus with date palm leaves. In the latter case there is a legitimate question of where they got the leaves, since Jerusalem is rather too high and cold for date palms. But the same could be asked about the prophetess Deborah’s palm (<s>00700400500010</s>), which was located between Ramah and Bethel, scarcely lower than Jerusalem. Jericho was known as the “city of palm trees” (<i>temarim</i> in Hebrew - <s>00503400300026 00700101600020 00700301300040 01402801500086</s>). Date fruits were eaten fresh or dried and pressed into “cakes,” and they were sometimes made into a drink. It is possible that in <s>00500800801030</s> the Hebrew word <i>devash</i> that we normally take as “honey” refers to a syrup made from dates. The leaves were and are used for mats, baskets, fences, and roofs. Date palms are now cultivated intensively in the Jordan and Aravah valleys, around the Dead Sea, and on the coastal plain of Israel. The word “date” entered English from Latin <i>dactylus</i> via Old French <i>datil</i>. Latin got it from Greek <i>daktylos</i>, meaning “finger.”</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The date palm typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters (33–66 feet) and has a cluster of immense leaves at the top. Each year, old leaves wither and droop, and people who own palms cut the old branches off. The tightly packed bunch of immature leaves is called <i>lulav</i> in Hebrew. Date palms start bearing fruit at around five to eight years of age. The sweet fruits, a little smaller than a human thumb, grow in large bunches. Inside the soft fruit is a very hard seed about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) long. Date palm trees are either male or female, and there are places where the trees of one sex grow but no fruit is seen, because they lack pollination. Farmers prefer to propagate them by cultivating the suckers that grow at the base of the tree, rather than from seeds, which would produce too many male trees. The fruit appears on the female tree in the summer (June-August).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0177_dates"/>Translators living along the West African coast often substitute the oil palm or the coconut palm for the date palm, which is found normally in desert areas. Others are familiar with the fan palm (<i>Borassus</i>, “ruhn palm”) but they should note that the shape of the leaf of the fan palm is quite different from that of the date palm. I am not aware of a non-European language that has a generic word for palm. Since the function of palm branches in the Festival of Shelters is to build rough shelters, the type of palm tree does not make a lot of difference. The same is true for references where the image of the palm is used as a decoration, as in the description of the Temple (see <s>01100602900026 01100603500010</s>). In cases where the fruit is mentioned, a transliteration is recommended, either from the Hebrew word <i>tamar</i> or from a major language.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In locations where oil and coconut palm trees are found, but no date palms, the oil palm is to be preferred. In places where no palms are found, it is still possible that the date fruit is found in markets, particularly in Muslim-dominated areas, where it may be a popular item for breaking the fast during Ramadan. In northern Nigeria, a dwarf species of date palm (<i>Phoenix reclinata</i>) grows in ravines and bears small edible fruits much like the big palm. At least one translation there (Berom) makes use of the local name.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>It would seem then that if the date palm is not known at all, the options here are:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. use the word for oil or coconut palm (and consider writing a footnote that indicates that the Hebrew words <i>tamar</i> and <i>tomer</i> and the Greek word <i>phoinix</i> refer to a similar tree that has a quite different fruit);</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. transliterate from Hebrew (<i>tomera</i>, <i>tamara</i>) and Greek (<i>fonis</i>, <i>fowinik</i>);</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. transliterate from a major language, for example, <i>nakhal</i> /<i>temer</i> (Arabic), <i>dattier</i> (French), <i>datil</i> /<i>palmera</i> (Spanish), <i>mtende</i> (Swahili), <i>khaji</i> (Hindi), <i>karchuram</i> (Tamil), and <i>haizao</i> (Chinese);</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>4. use a generic phrase appropriate to the context, for example, “beautiful tree.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00402400601004</s>: The first line of this verse reads “Like valleys [<i>nechalim</i>, plural of <i>nachal</i> ] that stretch afar.” The Hebrew word <i>nachal</i> refers literally to a “torrent” of water. Since that makes an odd parallel with gardens, aloes, and cedars, the majority of scholars believe it refers to date palms here based on a similar word in Arabic with that meaning. Many English versions have “palm groves” (<a>NRSV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, <a>REB</a>, <a>NJPSV</a>; similarly <a>CEV</a>) or “rows of palms” (<a>GNB</a>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01801503200012</s>: The Hebrew words <i>temurato</i> (“his recompense”) in verse 31 and <i>timmale'</i> (“It will be paid in full”) in verse 32 have been debated for centuries. Houbigant and others have said that <i>temurato</i> should be read as <i>timorato</i> (“his palm tree”), and <i>timmale'</i> should be read as <i>timmal</i> (“it will wither”; so Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac). This interpretation anticipates the Hebrew word <i>kipah</i> (“branch”) in verse 32, where the second line reads “and his branch will not be green.” Dhorme suggests that <i>temurato</i> should be read as <i>zemorato</i> (“his vine shoots”), which anticipates the line about grapevines in verse 33. <i>A Handbook on The Book of Job</i> supports using “palm tree” and “palm branch” in this passage. We do too.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01802901801018</s>: Instead of “sand,” the Septuagint reads “palm tree” (<i>phoinix</i>). Many scholars follow the Septuagint here, but some take <i>phoinix</i> as referring not to the date palm but to the legendary “Phoenix,” a bird that was believed to live a long life.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0040_fig_tree_leaves"/>Two types of fig trees are mentioned in the Bible, the Common Fig <i>Ficus carica</i> (Hebrew <i>te’enah</i>) and the Sycomore Fig <i>Ficus sycomorus</i> (Hebrew <i>shiqmah</i>; see <l target="FLORA:2.12">2.12 Vine</l>). They are closely related. The common fig tree grows not only in Israel, but throughout the world in warm climates. In the Holy Land it was a common source of food; the fruit was eaten both fresh and dried. Sometimes the dried ones were pressed together to form flat “cakes” or blocks (Hebrew <i>develah</i>). But, just as important, the large leaves of the fig make it an excellent shade tree. However, the first use of the fig mentioned in the Bible (<s>00100300700026</s>) was not for food or shade but for clothing; Adam and Eve sewed fig leaves for themselves to cover their nakedness.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The fig was probably domesticated in northwestern Turkey from a wild variety that grew there around 5000 years ago. Greek, Roman, and Egyptian records indicate that the fruits were popular. Figs are now grown especially in Israel, Turkey, Greece, Italy, and Portugal, as well as in the warm parts of the United States. The fig is distantly related to the mulberry (<i>Morus nigra</i>), breadfruit (<i>Artocarpus altilis</i>), jackfruit (<i>Artocarpus heterophyllus</i>), and Chinese mulberry (<i>Cudrania tricuspidata</i>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The fig is believed to be indigenous to western Asia and to have been distributed by humans and birds throughout the Mediterranean area. Remnants of figs have been found in excavations of sites traced to at least 5000 <a>B.C.</a></Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0219_fig_unripe"/>The domesticated fig grows to about 5–8 meters (17–26 feet) and has a round crown and very deep and round roots. The trunk may grow to be more than 70 centimeters (2 feet) thick. Fig trees may grow to be several decades old, if they are well cared for. Figs are usually propagated by planting cuttings. The pollination of the flowers is an amazingly intricate process closely linked to the life cycle of a tiny wasp, and the fact that fig trees, like papayas and date palms, are male or female. (There are now some kinds of figs that produce fruit without pollination.) The fruits are about the size of a hen’s egg and can be green, yellow, purple, or brown depending on the type. They are sweet and soft and difficult to transport. For that reason most farmers dry the fruits before shipping them. The “fruit” of the fig is technically a strangely shaped flower. Noting the absence of a “real” flower, the ancient people of India called it a flowerless tree.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Wild figs are common throughout the tropical world; there are at least eight hundred species of <i>Ficus</i>, thirty-two in southern Africa alone. The banyan, peepul, and bo are all types of fig. The fruits of wild fig trees are not nearly as juicy or sweet as those of the domesticated ones. In many places people eat the fruit when they find it in the wild, but do not market it or cultivate the trees. Translators are urged to use the local word, and, if necessary, use a footnote to indicate the difference between the local one and the biblical one. Where it is not known at all, transliterations from a major language may be used in nonfigurative contexts, for example, <i>fikus</i> (Latin), <i>teen</i> /<i>barchomi</i> (Arabic), <i>higo</i> /<i>higuera</i> (Spanish), <i>figue</i> (French), <i>Feige</i> (German), <i>fico</i> (Italian), <i>figuera</i> (Portuguese), <i>mu hwa gwa</i> (Korean), <i>anjeer</i> (Hindi), and <i>wu huwa guo</i> (Chinese).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0659_mulberry_leaf"/>The references to mulberry in the Scriptures are all controversial. However, Zohary, on the basis of cognate words in Sumerian (<i>messikanu</i>, <i>sukannu</i>) confidently associates the Hebrew word <i>mesukan</i> in <s>02304002000004</s> with the mulberry tree, as did Thompson before him. Further, they take the Greek word <i>sucaminos</i> in <s>04201700600028</s> as also cognate with Sumerian <i>sukannu</i>. Like the apple, the pomegranate, the fig and the pistachio, the Black Mulberry <i>Morus nigra</i> may have been introduced into the Holy Land from one of the neighboring countries like Persia (now Iran).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0658_mulberry"/>The black mulberry is a large, broad tree (6 meters [20 feet] high) that produces flowers and leaves in spring and loses its leaves every year in winter. The crown is broad and low. The trunk gets twisted as it grows old and may rot away, only to be replaced by another one from the same root. People pile stones up in order to support the low branches of old trees. The leaves are stiff, rough, and hairy. The flowers are pollinated by the wind, and the fruit is a rather tart, black berry about the size of a large cashew nut. In Europe and North America, people use mulberries mostly to make pies and wine. A different species, the white mulberry, has a whitish fruit.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The black mulberry tree is similar in size and shape to the sycomore fig (see <l target="FLORA:2.12">2.12 Vine</l>). In fact, the translators of the Septuagint introduced considerable confusion by translating the Hebrew word <i>shiqmah</i> as <i>sucaminos</i> (<s>01101002700040</s>; <s>01302702800014</s>; <s>01400101500048</s>; <s>01400902700040</s>; <s>01907804700014</s>; <s>02300900900012</s>; <s>03000701400042</s>). The confusion has been perpetuated in languages like German that refer to the sycomore fig as the “mulberry fig.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The New Testament reference to the mulberry in <s>04201700600028</s> occurs in Jesus’ parable about faith. “If you had faith like a mustard seed,” he said, “you could say to this mulberry tree (<i>sucaminos</i>), ‘Get up and throw yourself into the sea,’ and it would do so.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>07700603400016</s> tells us that soldiers showed the bright red juice of the mulberry to their elephants in order to provoke them to fight.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In China the main use of the mulberry tree (a white subspecies) is to feed the leaves to a certain type of caterpillar that produces silk threads. These threads are woven into cloth. There is evidence that in the early centuries of the Christian era the Mediterranean island of Cos and the Phoenician city of Sidon had industries that used a local type of silk moth, which fed on black mulberry leaves. Hepper (page 169) surmises that the silk referred to in <s>02601601000028 02601601300022</s> may have come from the precursors of these local industries.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0681_olive_tree"/> The olive family has over four hundred species in the world. Many of them grow in Africa, India, and Australia, but it is the one in the Bible, the European Olive <i>Olea europaea</i>, that has become famous. It is likely that the olive was domesticated in Egypt or the eastern Mediterranean basin in the third millennium <a>B.C.</a> The botanist Newberry argued that Egypt was its original home. We know from the Bible that olives grew in the hills of Samaria and in the foothills. There is a wild variety, called <i>Olea europaea sylvestris</i>, that is smaller than the domestic one; it produces a smaller fruit with less oil. The Apostle Paul refers to this wild variety in <s>04501101700018 04501102400030</s>. Olives are easily propagated by cuttings and by grafting fruitful species into less fruitful ones. They grow best on hillsides where the rain drains off quickly. The fruit forms by August but does not ripen until December or January.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The olive is not a big tree, reaching up to perhaps 10 meters (33 feet), but with pruning it is usually kept to around 5 meters (17 feet) tall. The leaves are grayish green above, and whitish underneath. The bark of young trees is silvery gray but gets darker and rougher as the tree ages. The trunk also gets twisted and hollow and may reach over a meter in thickness. Olives grow for hundreds of years, and some in Israel have possibly reached two thousand years.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The fruit of the olive is about 2 centimeters (1 inch) long and a bit more than a centimeter (1/2 inch) thick. It has a hard stone inside and a soft skin that covers the oily flesh. Today a mature tree may yield 10–20 kilograms (22–44 pounds) of fruit, which, when processed, will yield 1.3–2.6 kilograms (3–6 pounds) of oil (Hepper, page 107).</Paragraph>

People ate olive fruits, but more importantly, they squeezed the oil from the fruits, and used it for cooking, for lamps, for rubbing on the body, for medicine, and in religion. Jacob poured olive oil on the stone where he saw a vision of angels, declaring it a holy place (<s>00102801801042</s>). Moses, similarly, anointed the Tabernacle and its equipment with olive oil mixed with sweet-smelling resins (<s>00204000901008</s>). Aaron and the priests who served in the Tabernacle were also anointed (<s>00202902101024</s>). Eventually the ceremony was extended to prophets (<s>01910501501008 02306100101012</s>) and kings (<s>00901601301018 01100103901028</s>).

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0106_olive"/>Some types of wild olive grow in Africa, India, and Australia, but are not well-known. The so-called “African olive” (<i>Canarium schweinfurthii</i>; Hausa <i>atili</i>; Yoruba <i>origbo</i>; Efik <i>eben etridon</i>; Cameroun <i>abel</i>; Ivory Coast <i>aiele</i>; Ghana <i>bediwunua</i> /<i>eyere</i>; Uganda <i>mwafu</i>) produces a black, oil-bearing fruit much like an olive. It is common as a snack in northern Nigeria. The “Chinese olive” is also a species of <i>Canarium</i> and may be a possible cultural substitute, if it produces edible fruit and oil. The “Russian olive” grown in dry regions of the world is a member of the <i>Elaeagnus</i> family and not a true olive. A variety of olive (<i>Olea cuspidate</i>) is used for building in India and Nepal, but it is probably not possible to use it in the Bible except perhaps in a study Bible where you could say that the biblical olive was related to this tree.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Since most of the kinds of olive trees in the world do not have edible fruit, it may not be possible to substitute a local variety. If it is done, however, a footnote would be required saying that the Palestinian kind produced edible fruit and oil. If a variety of <i>Canarium</i> (for example, <i>atili</i> in northern Nigeria) is eaten in your area, you could use the local name for it. Otherwise transliterate from a major language, for example, <i>olivi</i> /<i>wolifu</i> (from English); <i>zayitu</i> (French, Hebrew), <i>zeitun</i> (Arabic), <i>asetuna</i> (Spanish), <i>azeitona</i> /<i>olivo</i> (Portuguese), <i>oliibu</i> (Korean), and <i>gan lan shu</i> / <i>mu xi lan</i> (Chinese).</Paragraph>

The Hebrew verb <i>tsahar</i> means “to press out oil” and by extension, “to glisten/shine.” In <s>01500600901042</s> the writer uses the Aramaic word for oil (<i>meshach</i> —coming from the root meaning “to anoint” or “to rub”) along with another Aramaic word referring to wine: <i>chamar</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The plant genus <i>Pistacia</i> has representatives throughout the world, especially in Europe and Asia. The fruit-bearing ones grow well in the Mediterranean region and in West Asia up to Pakistan, and they were probably there in Bible times. There are three species that concern us: <i>Pistacia vera</i>, the True Pistachio; the <i>Pistacia palaestina</i>; and the <i>Pistacia atlantica</i> (also called the Atlas pistacio or Mount Atlas mastic tree). The latter two are called <i>’elah</i> or <i>’alah</i> (“terebinth”) in the Bible; see <l target="FLORA:1.24">1.24 Terebinth</l>. Zohary holds that in <s>00104301100064</s> the <i>botnim</i> that Jacob’s sons carried to Egypt as a gift to Pharaoh could have been the fruit of any of these three species, since all grew there. He also believes that the place named Betonim in <s>00601302601018</s> is a reference to the fruit of either the terebinth or the true pistachio tree.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0720_pistachio"/>The true pistachio (<i>Pistacia vera</i>) is a small tree with many branches that lose their leaves in winter. The seeds are nuts with a hard, red, heart-shaped shell about 2 centimeters (1 inch) long, and the oily green kernel inside is about a centimeter (1/2 inch) long.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Whatever <i>botnim</i> referred to, whether true pistachio nuts or the fruit of the terebinth, they were obviously highly valued, as we see Jacob sending them with his sons as a gift to Pharaoh.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Pistachio nuts in European shops are often dyed red. This tradition started in the 1930s, when importers began dyeing the shells to hide blemishes that occurred during harvesting.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Since the only occurrence of <i>botnim</i> refers to the fruit, and we are not sure whether it is the fruit of the true pistachio or the terebinth, translators who live where these trees do not grow are free to follow a major language version, using a transliteration of pistachio or of terebinth, or even a generic term. Possible transliterations for pistachio are French <i>pistache</i>, Arabic <i>fustuq</i> /<i>futua</i>, Spanish <i>pistachio</i> /<i>alfonigo</i>, and Portuguese <i>alfoncico</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0729_pomegranate_tree"/>The Pomegranate <i>Punica granatum</i> has been grown from ancient times across the Middle East over to Iran and into northern India. It is widely cultivated throughout India and the drier parts of Southeast Asia, Malaya, the East Indies, and tropical Africa. Pomegranates are now found throughout the warm parts of southern Europe and across North Africa and Asia all the way to Nepal. Images of pomegranate fruits have been found in Pharaoh’s temple in Karnak, Egypt, dating from around 1480 <a>B.C.</a> In classical Latin the species name was <i>malum punium</i> (apple of Puni) or <i>malum granatum</i> (seedy apple). This has influenced the common name for pomegranate in many languages (for example, German <i>Granatapfel</i>, “seeded apple”). The English word “pomegranate” itself comes from Latin <i>pomum</i> (fruit, apple) via Old French; (compare <i>pomme</i> in French). The Arabic <i>rummân</i> passed into some other languages, including Portuguese <i>romã</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0727_pomegranate"/>The pomegranate is a small tree, growing to about 3–5 meters (10–17 feet) tall, with narrow, dark green leaves and many thorny branches. It has a lovely red flower. The fruit is a bit smaller than an orange and has a hard skin, which must be cut open to get at the tightly-packed pockets of seeds inside, each seed enclosed in a little bag of juicy pulp. The end of the fruit has a distinctive flower-like shape. The hard skin, which turns from green to red as it ripens, is used as a tanning agent, for medicine, and for ink. The seeds were sometimes made into wine. Pomegranate trees live up to two hundred years.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The pomegranate was one of the seven “special” foods mentioned in <s>00500800800020</s> that the Israelites would find in Canaan. The fruit was one of several brought back to the camp of the Israelites by the men who scouted out Canaan (<s>00401302300050</s>). In <s>00601503201016</s> it is a place name. In <s>02200400300024</s> the bride of the king is said to have cheeks like halves of a pomegranate, a reference, probably, to their red color. The flower-shaped end of the pomegranate fruit made it an attractive decoration, for example on the fringe of the priests’ robes (<s>00202803300010 00202803400008 00202803400008</s>) and on the columns and furniture of the Temple (<s>01202501700046</s>). One of the earliest artifacts we have of the Temple in Jerusalem is a pomegranate-shaped carving considered to be the head of a staff. The prophet Joel mentions the pomegranate as one of five species that were dying because of a drought and a locust plague (<s>02900101200016</s>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In Jewish tradition the pomegranate stands for righteousness, because it is said to have 613 seeds, corresponding to the 613 commands of the Torah. For this reason and others many Jews eat pomegranates on the Jewish New Year Festival (Rosh Hashanah). Jewish tradition also holds that the pointed calyx of the pomegranate is the original “design” for a royal crown.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Babylonians believed chewing pomegranate seeds before battle made them invincible. The Qur’an mentions pomegranates three times, twice as examples of the good things God creates, once as a fruit found in the Garden of Paradise.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0728_pomegranate_fruit"/>The pomegranate is only recently being grown outside of the Mediterranean area. In West Africa it has not yet become a popular fruit. Where it is known at all, it is called <i>rummân</i> (from Arabic). In <s>02200400300024</s> and <s>02200600700008</s> the references to the pomegranate are rhetorical. There a cultural equivalent representing redness or beauty could be used. Elsewhere in the Bible transliteration is advised, following a major language, for example, <i>roman</i> /<i>rumman</i> (Arabic), <i>romã</i> /<i>romeira</i> /<i>roman­zeiro</i> (Portuguese), <i>grenade</i> /<i>mangrano</i> (French), <i>seok ryu</i> (Korean). The word <i>pome</i> simply means “fruit,” so the basic word to transliterate from is <i>granate</i> (compare <i>granada</i> in Spanish). A possible expression is “garinada fruit.” The Latin phrase <i>Punica granatum</i> for pomegranate means the “grenade” of Punica (= Carthage), a city in present-day Tunisia. The Latin word <i>granatum</i> means “filled with many grains or seeds.” Reflecting this, Bambara of Guinea uses “karanati fruit.” One could also use the Hebrew <i>rimmon</i> as a base. Areas influenced by Arabic may find a word like <i>rummân</i>, for example, <i>roomaanoo</i> in Mandinka. A footnote could describe the fruit as similar to a guava, red and seedy.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Although the pomegranate has been introduced recently throughout Africa, it is not well-known, so the name will most likely need to be transliterated. As the English name is quite long, the translator is advised to translate from another source or look for ways to shorten it, such as “granata fruit.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00202803300010</s>: “On its skirts you shall make pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet stuff, around its skirts, with bells of gold between them.” Here the writer is talking about making images of pomegranate fruit from cloth (“blue and purple and scarlet stuff”). One could say something like “… take colored string [or, cotton] and make things like pomegranate fruit … .” Also consider using an illustration. Finally, one could consider using “like the fruit of trees” in the text, and designating the species (pomegranate) in a footnote. <a>LB</a> takes the pomegranates as embroidered, but the impression is given that the bells are also embroidered, which seems odd, as they need to tinkle (verse 35). <a>NCV</a> says “balls like pomegranates,” which is clear. For verses 33-34 <a>CEV</a> provides a helpful model, saying “Along the hem of the robe weave pomegranates of blue, purple, and red wool with a gold bell between each of them.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01100701800048</s>: Instead of “pomegranates,” some Hebrew manuscripts read “pillars” (<i>‘amudim</i> rather than <i>rimmonim</i>). <a>HOTTP</a> favors <i>‘amudim</i> here but only with a “C” rating. Possible reasons for supposing there was a change of the text from <i>‘amudim</i> to <i>rimmonim</i> are:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>a) The difficulty of the reading “pillars.” It is quite likely that the scribe felt that “pomegranates” made more sense.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>b) Similarity to parallel passages. In this case, the scribes probably looked at verses 20 and 42, and possibly at <s>01400301600030</s>, all of which have <i>rimmonim</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If “pomegranates” is chosen (so Septuagint, <a>RSV</a>, and most modern versions), there are still questions. It is impossible to tell from the Hebrew whether these bronze fruits were cast separately (as <a>NAB</a> clearly states), or whether they were hammered or etched into the bronze surface (<a>CEV</a> “designs that looked like pomegranates”).The essential thing to convey is that these objects are models or pictures of the fruit of the pomegranate, which is well described in <a>FFB</a>, pages 168–170.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0851_sycomore_fig_tree"/>Following Hepper, we favor the use of “sycomore” rather than “sycamore,” since the “o” spelling preserves the Latin (<i>sycomorus</i>) and Greek (<i>suko­morea</i>) better and is used in French. Note that the tree is spelled with an “o” in <a>KJV</a> and <a>NEB</a>. As Hepper observes (page 114), it may be useful to reserve the name “sycamore” for a kind of plane tree (<i>Platanus</i>) in the United States and a member of the <i>Acer</i> family in Britain.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Sycomore Fig <i>Ficus sycomorus</i>, also called the Mulberry Fig (compare German <i>Maulbeerfeigen­baum</i>), is a type of fig that is found especially in lowland areas in the Mediterranean region. It was known in Egypt as early as 3000 <a>B.C.</a> but also in the Indus Valley in India. Zohary surmises that the Israeli sycomores, found mostly down on the coastal plain, are survivors from an earlier time when this type of fig was more widespread.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The prophet Amos identified himself as “a dresser of sycamore trees” (<s>03000701400042</s>). It is possible that this refers to the practice of making a cut in the immature fruit, which has the effect of accelerating the growth of the fruit. Hepper (page 113) reports that this sudden growth is caused by ethylene gas released when the fruit is cut. Incidentally, today ethylene gas is used by fruit sellers to hasten the ripening of oranges and bananas.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0852_sycomore_fig"/>The sycomore fig is not a tall tree (up to 10 meters [33 feet]) but has large low, spreading branches—just right for a short man to climb up in order to see over a crowd of taller people (see the story of Zacchaeus in <s>04201900400016</s>). The fruit, while edible, is not as juicy or sweet as the more common variety. The most unusual thing about the fruit is that it grows in bunches right on the trunk and branches of the tree rather than among the leaves.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In <s>01101002700040</s> the sycomore is used as an image of something plentiful. The last half of this verse says “he [King Solomon] made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah.” Translators should take care with the logic here. The verse does not say that Solomon would introduce cedars into the lowlands (the Shephelah), but rather that just as there are plenty of sycomores in the lowlands, there will be plenty of cedars in the land of Israel.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0853_sycomore_fig_ripe"/>Translators need to deal with both sycomore and fig at the same time. If the translation leans toward foreignization, the translator may want to transliterate both fig and sycomore (<i>sikomori</i>, for example). It may be useful to use the full name sycomore fig in some cases. If a local type of fig is known, the translator could use the local name for the domestic fig (Hebrew <i>te’enah</i>, Greek <i>sukē</i>), and add the word “wild” or “lowland” when referring to the sycomore fig (Hebrew <i>shiqmah</i>, Greek <i>sukomorea</i>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Where figs are totally unknown, transliterations can be made from an international language, for example, French (<i>sycomore</i>), Spanish (<i>sicomoro</i>), or Hebrew (<i>shiqmah</i>). In contrast to the regular fig, the sycomore grows in the lower elevations (Shephelah), a fact that could potentially come into use in a translation (for example, “lowland fig”). <a>GECL</a> uses <i>Maulbeerfeigenbaum</i> (“mulberry fig”).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0048_vine_grapes_dark-skinned"/>The vine is a creeping plant that develops a woody stem when it matures. It grows along the ground until it finds a tree or other object to climb, using tendrils. It bears bunches of small round fruit that are sweet and juicy. Today farmers grow them commercially throughout the Mediterranean area, in South Africa, in North America, and in many other countries. The first reference to the vine in the Bible (<s>00100902000018</s>) tells us that Noah planted a vineyard (Hebrew <i>kerem</i>) and that he made an alcoholic drink from the fruit. Farmers since then have improved on the size, color, and quality of the fruit by careful pruning and selection until now there are at least 65 kinds of grapevines. Like many other plants in temperate areas, the vine has leaves that appear in early spring. After the fruit is picked and the weather gets cold, the leaves drop off and the plant is bare until the following spring.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A typical vineyard in Bible times was surrounded by a stone fence. It had a stone tower from which the owner could watch for predators, and a place to squeeze the juice out of the fruits.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>References to the vine and its fruits in the Bible are found in descriptions of farms, of sacrifices, and of social interaction.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0273_grape"/>The vine is the most frequently cited plant in the Bible, and that alone makes it special. Vines, grapes, raisins, and wine were a major element of Jewish life, so it is not a surprise that the vine and its products are used figuratively probably more than any other Bible plant. After the flood purified the earth at the time of Noah, the vine became the means by which the human race was plunged again into sin (<s>00100902000018</s>). We know from Jacob’s blessing in <s>00104901100008 00104901200008</s>, from <s>02301601000024</s>, from <s>03000901300028</s>, and from many other passages that the vine was the symbol of blessing, prosperity, and happiness. The fact that there were groups like the Nazirites and Rechabites who abstained from drinking wine simply shows the radical self-denial that these people imposed on themselves (<s>00400600300032 00400600400018</s>; <s>02403500200040 02403500500022 02403500600010</s>). A drink offering of wine was an important part of worship (<s>00202904000032</s>), and the image of contentment was “every man under his vine and under his fig tree” (<s>03300400400010</s>). Jotham includes the vine in his well-known Parable of the Trees (<s>00700900701000</s> ff.). In the New Testament, Jesus rescued a man from humiliation at a wedding party by miraculously providing a fresh supply of wine (<s>04300200101000</s> ff.). He compared his teaching to wine. Wine becomes a major symbol in the Christian community when Jesus foreshadows his crucifixion by comparing the wine poured out in the Passover celebration to his blood (<s>04002602701000 04002602801000 04002602900028</s>). He speaks of the need for Christians to be like the branches of the vine, drawing their nourishment from him, the True Vine (<s>04301500100008</s> ff.). Nearly every New Testament writer makes some metaphorical reference to the vine or its products.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>shekar</i> (“strong drink”) probably refers to a alcoholic drink made from grain, honey or dates, but could also have been distilled from wine.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><b>Vine and vineyard</b>: There are around 65 kinds of grapevines (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) found in the Northern Hemisphere. They belong to a larger family of creeping plants called <i>Vitaceae</i>, which has over 800 species throughout the world including many in the tropical and warm climates of the world.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Grapevines have occasionally been grown in West Africa (for example, in The Gambia and in northern Nigeria) but are not well known even where they are grown commercially. Attempts at substituting a local tree name have not been entirely successful because the species chosen is usually not cultivated and/or does not have the same economic or social function that the grape had in Israel.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Thus it is probably best to use a transliteration from a major language. However, in parts of Nigeria and perhaps elsewhere, the word <i>grep</i> refers to “grapefruit” and should be avoided in translation. A transliteration from “vine” or “wine” is preferred, although a translator needs to be careful. The English word “vine” refers to any creeping plant, but it also refers to a particular kind of vine that produces grapes (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>). This can be confusing. Furthermore, translators in English-speaking countries should think carefully about what they are going to do with the word “wine.” In The Gambia, Mandinka translators first used “wayini tree” but later concluded that it may be better to have a word for “vine” that is not necessarily identical with “wine.” <i>Bine</i>, from <i>binekaro</i> (“vinegar”), was considered, as was <i>inabi</i> (“grape”) from Arabic.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Languages that borrow the Arabic word <i>inabi</i> must deal with the fact that this word bears an unfortunate resemblance to <i>annabi</i> (“prophet”) and new readers reading “water of inabi” in a context of prophecy may associate it, for better or worse, with prophets and prophecy. In northern Nigeria church people have gotten used to <i>inabi</i> in the New Testament even though many of them don’t know what it is. Rubassa in Nigeria uses a wild grape-like plant (<i>afwafwa</i>)**, and Igala has used the same species (<i>achiwebetema</i>) for years. Likewise, two translations in Mali and Burkina Faso use their local name for a wild vine (<i>Lannea microcarpa</i>) for the biblical vine. There is a species (<i>Rhoicissus tridentata</i>) in southern and eastern Africa known as “African grape” (locally called “bobbejaantou”). In such cases translators should write a footnote (or glossary item) stating that the grapes of Bible times were larger and sweeter than the local variety, and that they were cultivated extensively as a source for producing beverages. Other possibilities for transliteration are: <i>vinyola</i> /<i>videra</i> (Portuguese), <i>vitis</i> (Latin), and <i>inab</i> (Arabic).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Fruit of the vine</b> (Hebrew <i>‘enav</i>; Greek <i>botrus</i>, <i>staphulē</i>): There is some evidence that <i>botrus</i> refers to a bunch of grapes, while <i>staphulē</i> refers to individual grapes. According to Louw and Nida (<i>Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament based on Semantic Domains</i>), however, both words may refer to individual grapes as well as bunches of grapes. The Hebrew word <i>tirosh</i> is equivalent to the word “vintage” in English, that is, the grape harvest and possibly the first squeezing of the grapes. It is normally used along with the words referring to the olive harvest (<i>yitshar</i>) and grain harvest (<i>dagan</i>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Vineyard</b>: The typical translation solution for translating “vineyard” is to take the word chosen for “vine” and expand to “field/farm of vine trees.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Beverages made from vine fruit</b>: Grape juice contains yeast organisms that make it ferment naturally, converting natural sugar into alcohol or vinegar within a day or two, depending on the weather (Hepper, page 101). In normal wine preparation, the juice (called “must”) is allowed to ferment for six weeks, after which the clear liquid is poured out into another container leaving behind the sediment (the “lees”; see <s>02404801100018</s>) consisting of seeds, twigs, and skins. Once it is in sealed containers for storage it is called <i>yayin</i> in Hebrew. Translators from churches that require abstinence from alcohol are tempted to avoid or downplay the fact that <i>yayin</i> refers to an alcoholic drink. This is difficult to defend since the Jews had no refrigeration to keep <i>yayin</i> cool enough to prevent fermentation.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>tirosh</i>, sometimes translated “new wine,” is problematical. There is no phrase “new wine” in the Hebrew Old Testament or the Septuagint translation of it. The Septuagint usually translated <i>tirosh</i> simply as wine (<i>oinos</i> in Greek). In the New Testament Jesus creates the phrase “new wine” for his parable of the wineskins, linking it with new wineskins (<s>04000901700006</s>; <s>04100202200008</s>; <s>04200503700008 04200503800004</s>); it seems to be a made-up phrase there, not a technical expression. In <s>00400600300032 00400600400018</s> the Nazirites were prohibited from drinking wine, strong drink, and vinegar, or even eating grapes or grapeskins, but <i>tirosh</i> is not mentioned there, suggesting that it may have even been an abstract term like the English word “vintage,” which refers to the grape harvest. The word <i>tirosh</i> is usually used with the Hebrew words for unprocessed grain (<i>dagan</i>) and olive oil (<i>yitshar</i>), in contexts that refer to the produce of the land. What <a>RSV</a> calls “new wine” in these passages is better rendered “vintage” in English. In <s>02302400700008</s> <i>tirosh</i> seems to refer to the grapevines themselves (so <a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, <a>NLT</a>). In <s>03300601500028</s> it refers to grapes. In <s>02900202400020</s> it seems to refer to freshly squeezed grape juice. It occurs only twice with the Hebrew verb for “drink” (<s>02306200800044</s>; <s>03300601500028</s>), but in both those passages it can be taken as metonymic, not literal.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Some have tried to argue that <i>tirosh</i> was unfermented grape juice, which may be true in <s>02900202400020</s>, but that is rather beside the point since it does not refer to a beverage in most cases. Even if <i>tirosh</i> is assumed to include the juice in its first stages on the first day after squeezing, it would have been mildly alcoholic since it has a kind of yeast in it and the Jews had no means of refrigeration. A case in point is <s>02800401100010</s>, which says “<i>Yayin</i> and <i>tirosh</i> take away understanding.” Why? Surely because they contain alcohol! Another example is <s>00700901300018</s>, where the grapevine in the Parable of the Trees says, “Shall I give up my <i>tirosh</i> that cheers gods and men?” I take <i>tirosh</i> here as a metonym for the final product. But if it is literal, why would it cheer anyone, if not because of its alcoholic content?</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Sometimes translators, even if they concede the above, prefer to use a literal expression like “wayin” precisely because it is not well known, and thus hides the problem. This is not very satisfactory. They need to know that there are possibilities for translating these words contextually. For example, in passages where <i>tirosh</i> refers to a product of the land along with grain and oil, a phrase like “the juice of vayin fruit” is an acceptable translation of <i>tirosh</i>. In places where the reference is to drunkenness, the local word for alcoholic drink may be appropriate, and in fact, need not cause any offense. The compulsion to be concordant with English “wine” is what causes the problem.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>On the other hand there are communities where <i>yayin</i>, <i>tirosh</i>, and the Greek word <i>oinos</i> have been translated using a word for a locally popular alcoholic brew, such as guinea corn (sorghum) beer. This, however, is not technically accurate. Properly speaking, wine is made from fruit, and beer from grain.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There are a few other Hebrew words that may refer to wine (for example <i>chemer</i>, <i>sove’</i>, <i>mezeg</i>; see <a>WTH</a>, <l target="REALIA:9.1">9.1 Wine</l>) but they may be generic, or abstract, or poetic, or they refer to a drink made from fruit other than the fruit of the vine, such as pomegranates or dates, so we do not consider them here. In a number of places, wine is referred to indirectly. When a drink offering of wine was required, as in <s>00501501401022</s>, the people are told to bring the offering “out of your wine press [<i>yeqev</i> in Hebrew].”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00402800700032</s>: <a>RSV</a> renders the Hebrew word <i>shekar</i> in this verse as “strong drink.” <a>NIV</a> and <a>NJB</a> take it literally here, saying “fermented drink/liquor.” <a>NLT</a> is similar with “alcoholic drink.” <a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, and others just use “wine.” (<a>REB</a> cleverly does both by rendering this verse as “The wine for the proper drink-offering is to be a quarter of a hin to each ram; you are to pour out this strong drink … .”) Some commentators see this as a strange use of <i>shekar</i>, which normally refers to alcoholic drinks made from grain or honey. They think “wine” was intended and that a late editor used <i>shekar</i> possibly under the influence of Akkadians, who always talked about using <i>shikar</i> for any kind of libation. See <a>WTH</a>, pages 374–375, for further discussion.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0898_walnut_tree"/>The identity of <i>’egoz</i> (“nut orchard”) mentioned in <s>02200601100006</s> is debated. It may well have been the walnut (<a>CEV</a>, <a>GW</a>, <a>FRCL</a>, <a>GECL</a>), since this tree was well known in biblical times, even though it is not mentioned in the Bible except for this possible reference. The majority of versions play it safe with “nut orchard” (<a>RSV</a>) “grove of nut trees” (<a>NIV</a>), or something similar. <a>GNB</a> has “almond,” which is also possible, although one could ask why the writer would not have used one of the two normal Hebrew words for almond (<i>luz</i> or <i>shaqed</i>) if that is what he meant.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Jewish historian Josephus noted that walnuts were cultivated in the area of Lake Galilee, and other early Jewish writings describe various walnut products, including the oil, tannin (used for leather processing), and wood. In East Jerusalem there is a place called the Valley of Walnuts. Further support for the identification of <i>’egoz</i> as walnut comes from the Arabic cognates <i>goz</i> and <i>jauz</i> referring to the walnut.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0897_walnut_bark"/>The Middle Eastern Walnut Tree <i>Juglans regia</i> grows to around 6–8 meters (20–26 feet) and has a stout trunk with many branches and a rounded crown. The wood, being very hard, is excellent for furniture. The tree is native to southeastern Europe, and there were once also forests of walnuts in the Caucasus, northern Turkey, Iran, and other West Asian countries. It was probably introduced into Canaan from Turkey or what is now Iran.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There are forty subspecies of walnuts spread throughout the temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and the Americas, all the way down to the Andes Mountains. A type of walnut is also found in Japan. There are also trees in tropical areas called “walnut” because of some similarity to the true walnut. For example, the so-called African walnut (or Nigerian golden walnut) is the <i>Lovoa trichilioides</i>; the East Indian walnut is the <i>Albizia lebbeck</i>; the New Guinea walnut is a species of <i>Dracontomelon</i>; the Otaheite walnut is the <i>Aleurites moluccana</i>; the Australian walnut is the <i>Endiandra palmerstonii</i>. The best-known member of the genus is the Persian Walnut or Common Walnut <i>Juglans regia</i>, native from the Balkans in southeastern Europe, southwestern and central Asia, and southwestern China. The Persian walnut is often but incorrectly known as English walnut in the United States (the species is not native to England). The world’s largest and oldest wild walnut forests are in Jalal-Abad province of Kyrgyzstan, at Arslanbob.</Paragraph>

Walnut trees feature positively in Greek and European mythology, but during the Dark Ages of Europe, people came to fear them since the dense leaves were thought to be hiding places for demons. The Arabs used walnut wood for shields and made ink from the shells of the nuts. The nuts and oil were also considered medicinal.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The English word “nut” is a generic term used to refer to a strange variety of seeds, fruits, and roots (peanuts). There is unlikely to be such a generic word in many languages. So either a more general phrase like “garden of fruit trees” or a more specific name is more likely to be required. If a specific transliteration is desired, “walnut” perhaps has more in favor of it than “almond.” Translators living in areas where the true walnut grows are encouraged to use it. Translators living in areas where there are so-called “African walnuts” like the species (<i>Lovoa trichilioides</i>) in Nigeria, can use such equivalents as well, even though they are not botanically exact.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Since <s>02200601100006</s> is a poetical passage, the translator may choose to “domesticate” the text by using an appropriate local equivalent or to “foreignize” the text by using a transliteration from a major language. Domestication will probably sound more poetic, and a footnote can give the botanical facts as far as we know them. On the other hand, a generic phrase like “garden of fruit trees” is not necessarily unpoetic.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>I would favor something in this order of preference:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. generic “garden of fruit trees”;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. local equivalent of a particularly tasty fruit;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. transliteration from “walnut” in a major language. Some models are Arabic <i>djawz</i>, Spanish <i>nogal comun</i>, French <i>noix royal</i> / <i>noix comun</i>, Portuguese <i>noguera comun</i>, and Chinese <i>hu tao</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><s>00100200501000</s> refers to a time “when no plant [<i>siach</i> in Hebrew] of the field was yet in the earth and no herb [<i>‘esev</i> ] of the field had yet sprung up—for the <a>LORD</a> God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground.” If you take this verse as a chiasmus, tilling the soil goes with <i>siach</i>, and rain on the land goes with <i>‘esev</i>. You might conclude that <i>siach</i> refers to domestic plants and that <i>‘esev</i> refers to wild plants. However, if they are both “of the field,” that seems unlikely. In any case, we learn from <s>00100201501000</s> that the man was expected to till the ground. Later, in <s>00100400201000 00100400301000</s> Cain is described as “a tiller of the ground,” and he brought “the fruit of the land” to Yahweh as a sacrifice. Archeologists tell us that around 7000 <a>B.C.</a> in the area of northeastern Iraq, people were already raising two kinds of wheat, as well as barley and some pulses (beans, peas, or lentils). Carbonized grains of both wheat and barley, dating from the sixth millennium <a>B.C.</a>, have been found by archeologists. However, agriculture may go back even earlier. In the 1960s researchers digging on the Turkish plateau unearthed an actual city, Catal Hüyük, dating possibly to 8000 <a>B.C.</a>, in which they found bins for grain, mortars for removing the husks of the grain, and stone blocks used for grinding the grain. A dense population like Catal Hüyük would require some sort of agriculture.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the Holy Land, excavations in Jericho going down to levels thousands of years old show that the farmers there probably planted and harvested a few types of legume (bean or pea-like plants).</Paragraph>

          <Heading>At least four types of grain are mentioned in the Bible: barley, millet, sorghum, and wheat. In addition to these types of grain, Hebrew words for things such as “threshing floor,” “sickle,” and “winnow” attest to the prominence of grain in the life of the ancient Israelites.</Heading>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><a>KJV</a>, <a>REB</a>, and some other versions, following British usage, use “corn” as a generic term to cover crops such as wheat and barley, while <a>RSV</a>, the New King James Version (<a>NKJV</a>), and many other versions, following American usage, use “grain” as the generic term. Versions such as <a>GNB</a> have British editions and American editions that accommodate to the different usages. Although maize as we know it now did not exist in Bible times, we may need to refer to it as a species, and we will call it “maize,” following the British tradition, and use “grain” as the generic term, following American usage.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Generic words can cause problems for a translator. In <s>00100101101000 00100101201000</s> we find the Hebrew phrase <i>‘esev mazri‘a zera‘</i> (“plants yielding seed”) standing in contrast to the phrase <i>‘ets peri ‘oseh peri</i> (“fruit trees bearing fruit”). Some English versions take “plants yielding seed” as referring to “grain” (<a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, <a>NCV</a>), whereas others use broader expressions such as “seed-bearing plants” (<a>NIV</a>, <a>NJB</a>, <a>NJPSV</a>) or “plants that bear seed” (<a>REB</a>). The writer of Genesis may be using a traditional Hebrew plant taxonomy that divides useful flora into two categories, namely seed-bearing plants and fruit-bearing plants. If so, translators should try to render “plants yielding seed” with an expression that includes more species than just the grains. After all, onions, beans, peas, melons, and other plants bear seeds, as well as grain.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>dagan</i> occurs forty times in the Old Testament (for example, <s>00102702800034</s>, <s>00102703700042</s>; <s>00401801200018</s>, <s>00401802700014</s>; <s>00500701300028</s>; <s>00501101400024</s>), and it is often translated “grain.” However, in Bible times the word <i>dagan</i> included peas, beans, lentils, and cumin as well as what we normally call “grain” from grasses or cereals. In these forty references <i>dagan</i> is paired with the Hebrew word <i>tirosh</i> (“grape harvest”) in all but ten. The Hebrew word <i>yitshar</i> (“newly pressed oil”) is mentioned in twenty of them. All three words include the concept of “newly harvested.” They express the idea of “produce of the land,” as when Isaac blesses Jacob (<s>00102702800034</s>):</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Old Testament has many other Hebrew words and phrases that refer to grain. Since these generic terms can cause problems for translators, we will consider them one by one:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Bar</i>: This word can refer to grain on a threshing floor (<s>02900202400010</s>) or to grain that is stored (<s>00104103500032</s>). It is used to refer to kernels of grain in contrast to chaff in <s>02402302800042</s>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0055_barleyhead"/>Barley <i>Hordeum distichum</i> or <i>Hordeum vulgare</i> is a type of grass like wheat and rice. It has been cultivated in the Middle East for thousands of years and is now one of the most prominent seed crops grown in the world. Twenty species are known, of which eight are European. Barley needs less rain than wheat does, so in the Holy Land it was typically found in the drier areas above the coastal plain and near the desert. From <s>01200700100040</s> and <s>06600600600034</s> we know that barley was considered inferior to wheat and was often used to feed animals, as it is today. When the wheat supply ran out, people had to make their bread with barley. Barley was gathered before wheat, the harvest coming around March or April in the lower regions and in May in the mountains (see <s>00200903100012 01200404200032</s>). In Egypt and in ancient Greece barley was used to make beer.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Barley is a plant of temperate zones, like Europe and the Near East; it does not grow well in the tropics. However, barley has been recently introduced along with wheat into many parts of the world for brewing beer and other malted drinks. It is also known to have grown in Korea as early as 1500 <a>B.C.</a> along with wheat and millet. It is becoming known in Malay as <i>barli</i>. Except for the reference in Judges, all references to barley in the Bible are non-rhetorical, so unrelated cultural equivalents are discouraged. Some receptor language speakers may coin a name for it as in Malay, or the translator can use a transliteration from Hebrew (<i>se‘orah</i>), Latin (<i>horideyo</i>), or from a major language (for example, Arabic <i>sha‘ir</i>, Spanish <i>cebada</i>, French <i>orge</i>, Portuguese <i>cevada</i>, Swahili <i>shayiri</i>), together with a classifier, if there is one (for example, “grain of shayir”). One translation used “rice of baali” but ran into a problem: Rice is now imported to parts of West Africa from Bali. Not surprisingly, it is called “rice of Bali” and was confused with “rice of baali.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00200903100012</s> reads “The flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.” The plants and developmental phases referred to here can be confusing if translated literally. Two possible ways to render this verse are:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. Use generic words plus a transliteration (for example, “grain of barli,” “plant of filas”), particularly in first half of the verse. The generic terms can be repeated optionally in the second half by saying “for the grain had already produced heads and the plants had flowers.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. Identify the plants generically and then put the actual name in parentheses or in footnotes; for example, the whole verse may be rendered “The crops that were ripe (<i>barli</i>) and those that were budding (<i>filakis</i>) were destroyed.” (The Hebrew chiastic structure has been rearranged in this example.)</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0632_millet"/>To illustrate the siege of Jerusalem, Ezekiel is instructed to make a loaf of bread out of wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet (<i>dochan</i> in Hebrew), and spelt in <s>02600400900026</s>. In Arabic millet is called <i>dukhn</i> or <i>dochna</i>, suggesting that the Hebrew word <i>dochan</i> could indeed be millet. Some scholars believe that Millet <i>Panicum miliaceum</i> or <i>Panicum callosum</i> was first domesticated in Ethiopia, but others say in India or the East Indies. From one of those places it was carried into Mesopotamia around 3000 <a>B.C.</a> If that is so, it may have been known to the people of Israel during their stay in Egypt as well as after the conquest of Canaan. Zohary implies that <i>dochan</i> was either millet or sorghum (see <l target="FLORA:3.1.3">3.1.3 Sorghum (durra)</l>). In <s>02602701700022</s> a reference is made to <i>pannag</i>, which Moldenke takes as possibly referring to millet, on the basis of the fact that in Syriac <i>pannag</i> refers to millet. However, Hepper says that neither millet nor sorghum reached the Mediterranean area before the Christian era, making it unlikely that <i>dochan</i> or <i>pannag</i> refer to either millet or sorghum.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Today millet is used throughout the world for porridge, alcoholic beverages, and as animal food. It is not good for bread, which may be significant in the incident mentioned in <s>02600400900026</s>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>If indeed millet was grown at all in Old Testament times, it would have been a short variety less than 1 meter (3 feet) in height. It has a single head on a stalk, with many tiny seeds, so the Latin name is <i>miliaceum</i> (“million seeds”).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>There are six hundred kinds of <i>Panicum</i> species growing in the warm and tropical zones of the world, many of them domesticated, and two in Europe. Translators who do not have a local word for millet will need to use a transliteration from a major language, for example, French <i>millet</i>, Portuguese <i>miliyo</i>, and Spanish <i>mijo</i>. Since the references to millet are part of lists in non-rhetorical contexts, there is no need to look for a cultural equivalent.</Paragraph>

              <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0821_sorghum"/><i>Sorghum vulgare</i> or <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> (known in West Africa as guinea corn or kint) may have originated in northeastern Africa (probably Sudan) and been carried through southwestern Asia to India as early as 2000 <a>B.C.</a> If so, it could have been known to the Israelites at the time of the conquest, and could be the <i>dochan</i> of <s>02600400900026</s> (see <l target="FLORA:3.1.2">3.1.2 Millet</l>). According to Hepper, sorghum was only introduced into the Holy Land around the time of Christ, so the word <i>dochan</i> cannot refer to it. It has also been suggested that <i>dochan</i> refers to the “reed” (see <l target="FLORA:5.1.4">5.1.4 Reed (common reed, giant reed)</l>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Sorghum is now the world’s fourth most important cereal after wheat, rice, and maize. It is used not only for food, but also for the sweet juice from its stalk, and for brooms and brushes.</Paragraph>

It is better to transliterate this term. However, if sorghum is found to be accurate, translators in Africa should know that sorghum is also called guinea corn, durra, dari, and jowar (Hausa <i>dawa</i>, Arabic <i>hhash</i>, French <i>sorgo</i>, Mandinka <i>kintoo</i>, Swahili <i>mkota</i>). In China it is called <i>kaolang</i>. In the United States it is sometimes called milo or broom corn.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0904_wheatfield"/>Two kinds of wild wheat have grown in the open deciduous oak woodland in the northern part of the Fertile Crescent for several thousand years: Einkorn Wheat <i>Triticum monococcum</i> and Emmer Wheat <i>Triticum dicoccum</i>. Both came into cultivation together with barley. Just before the time of the Romans, the Naked Bread Wheat or Hard Wheat <i>Triticum durum</i> started replacing the hulled varieties. This then became the favorite type of wheat for bread and macaroni. Spelt is a submember of the <i>Triticum aestivum</i> species. Unfortunately, according to one dictionary, spelt is also used as a local name for emmer wheat.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <a>RSV</a> and some other versions, the generic Hebrew word <i>bar</i> has been rendered “wheat” in <s>02402302800021 03000501100016 03000800500030 03000800600028</s>. This is legitimate, since the grain referred to by <i>bar</i> was probably wheat. However, it might be better to say “grain” in these passages.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The most important early wheat for the Israelites was emmer, probably the only wheat known in Egypt, and referred to in Hebrew as <i>chittah</i>. However, according to Hepper, the seven-headed wheat of the Egyptian king’s dream (<s>00104100500018 00104100600008 00104100700008</s>) suggests that there may also have been <i>Triticum turgidum</i> (rivet wheat) in the emmer group. The Hebrew word <i>kusemeth</i> probably refers to a type of emmer wheat that the Egyptians called <i>swt</i>. <a>KJV</a> renders <i>kusemeth</i> as “rye” in <s>00200903200006</s> and <s>02302802500028</s> (24), but this is not correct since rye is a European grain that was not known in Israel in Bible times.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>If wheat is unfamiliar, translators can transliterate from a major language in non-rhetorical contexts (for example, English <i>witi</i>, Portuguese <i>trigo</i>, French <i>ble</i> or <i>froment</i>, Swahili <i>ngano</i>, Arabic <i>kama</i> /<i>alkama</i>). The transliteration may add a generic tag such as “grain.” The New Testament passages are mostly rhetorical, opening the possibility for a metaphorical equivalent.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00200903200006 00200903200006</s>: “But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they are late in coming up.” In this verse <a>RSV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, <a>NJB</a>, and <a>NAB</a> render the Hebrew words <i>chittah</i> as “wheat” and <i>kusemeth</i> as “spelt.” <a>REB</a> has “wheat” and “vetches.” Zohary and Hepper both say that rendering “spelt” as <i>kusemeth</i> is erroneous. <i>Chittah</i> and <i>kusemeth</i> are simply two kinds of wheat. <i>Chittah</i> was the more valued because it was easier to harvest. <i>Kusemeth</i> was still useful since it could grow in drier and less fertile areas.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In this verse <a>GNB</a> combines <i>chittah</i> and <i>kusemeth</i> as “wheat.” <a>CEV</a> is similar with “wheat crops,” and so is <a>NCV</a> with “wheat crops.” Following the lead of our suggestion for barley and flax in the previous verse (see <l target="FLORA:3.1.1">3.1.1 Barley</l>), this verse may be rendered “but the crops that ripen later, that is, different kinds of witi, were not spoiled.” A transliteration of the Hebrew word <i>kusemeth</i> is also possible. This word may also be rendered “bush wheat” or “upland wheat” on the analogy of “upland rice.”</Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>For “flour,” the food product resulting from grinding wheat, see <l target="REALIA:9.4">9.4 Bread</l>.</Paragraph>

    <Title>Leafy vegetables</Title>

        <Section>
          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>We consider here leafy vegetables that were either grown or gathered, or both. Four types are listed in the Bible: bitter herbs, garlic, leeks, and onions. Apart from these, we know from excavations in the Near East and from Greek and Roman literature that other species of leafy vegetables, such as garden peas and fenugreek (literally “Greek hay”), were harvested and eaten for centuries and even millennia before Bible times. They were almost certainly eaten in Bible times, even though we find no reference to them in Scripture.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>‘esev</i>, which occurs thirty-three times in the Old Testament, means “herbs,” usually edible ones (see, for example <s>00100900300024</s>). According to Zohary, the Hebrew phrase <i>‘esev hassadeh</i> (“grass/plants of the field”) presumably refers to edible herbs, pot herbs, and other plants that were gathered in the wild (see, for example, <s>01201902600018</s>). However, as domestication was still going on in Bible times, it is sometimes impossible to know whether a food item was cultivated or gathered.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Another generic Hebrew expression for vegetables is <i>’oroth</i> found in <s>01200403900018</s>, where a young prophet goes out to gather <i>’oroth</i> in the field. Zohary, noting that the incident took place near Gilgal in the Jordan Valley, suggests that <i>’oroth</i> may well refer to the garden rocket, known in Arabic as <i>jarjir</i>. His case rests on the fact that the Talmud equates <i>’oroth</i> with <i>gargir</i>. However, the context suggests a general word, so “vegetables” or “herbs” is still the best guess here. This is supported by the fact that the word is plural in form, as well as by the Aramaic translation, which uses a word that is unquestionably generic. <i>’Oroth</i> comes from the Hebrew root <i>’arah</i> (meaning “to gather, collect, pluck”), which also supports that it has here the general idea of “things gathered.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Another generic Hebrew word here is <i>chatsir</i> (occurring twenty-two times), which Zohary says first referred to “leek” (see <s>00401100500040</s>), but later changed to mean “grazing grass” or “field herbs” (see, for example, <s>01903700200008</s>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew noun <i>deshe’</i> (occurring fourteen times) is a general term for any plant. <s>00100101100014</s> uses this noun and it verbal form, which are rendered “put forth vegetation.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Another general Hebrew word for vegetables is <i>yaraq</i>, which occurs in <s>00501101000060 01102100200034 02001501700006</s>. In <s>01102100200034</s> King Ahab covets Naboth’s vineyard to use as his <i>gan yaraq</i> (“vegetable garden”). This sort of expression can cause problems for translators because of the taxonomy and availability of generic terms. Many languages will have words for various types of agricultural plots depending on what is cultivated therein. Naboth’s vineyard was right next to the king’s palace, so the word for “vegetable garden” needs to be appropriate to that situation. If no specific word is available, translators may use a phrase such as “place where I can grow vegetables” or “place where I can plant things.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>zeru‘a</i> /<i>zero‘nim</i> (<s>00301103700018 02306101100020 02700101200024 02700101600028</s>) is a nominal form of the verb “to plant,” and it literally means “thing sown.” Some versions have rendered it “seed,” “plant” or “what is sown,” depending on the context. Several versions use “vegetables” in <s>02700101200024 02700101600028</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek word <i>lachanon</i> is a generic word for vegetables in <s>04501400200018</s>. In <s>04201104200030</s> it includes mint and rue, so it is appropriately translated “herb.” <a>RSV</a> renders it “shrubs” in <s>04001303200026</s> and <s>04100403200020</s> since it refers to the mature plant of the mustard seed in those passages.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0127_chicory"/>The Hebrew word <i>merorim</i> in <s>00201200800032 00400901100036</s> is a plural form of <i>maror</i>, which is derived from the root <i>marar</i> meaning “to be bitter” (compare the name “Mara” in <s>00800102000020</s>), so it could be either a specific plant or a generic word. Zohary says <i>merorim</i> may refer to the Dwarf Chicory <i>Cichorium pumilum</i>, Reichardia <i>Reichardia tingitana</i>, and/or perhaps some other plant known to have bitter leaves. Moldenke suggests endive, dandelion, and sorrel. In addition to the above plants, the Mishnah names lettuce, eryngo, horseradish, and sow thistle. In other words, the rabbis considered any of these plants acceptable to fulfill the commandment to eat <i>merorim</i> at the Passover meal.</Paragraph>

Presumably the herbs were cooked into some kind of stew or sauce that would be used in this sort of hasty situation.</Paragraph>

Large numbers of these plants have been found in ancient tombs in Egypt and the Dead Sea area dating around 3500–3000 <a>B.C.</a>, attesting to their popularity long before the days of the Exodus. The Greek writer Pliny knew of three types of garlic. They were used as offerings for the gods, as medicine, as food flavoring, and in preserving meat.</Paragraph>

These sections are called “cloves” in English. Because of its distinctive taste and smell, garlic is used for seasoning food throughout the world and also as medicine.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Garlic originated in the Near East, although its wild ancestor is uncertain. Garlic is now grown throughout the world, so local words are often available. If not, since the context of <s>00401100500056</s> is non-rhetorical, a transliteration from a major language is advisable (for example, Arabic <i>tawm</i> /<i>toum</i>, French <i>ail</i>, Spanish <i>ajo</i> /<i>aho</i>, Portuguese <i>alho</i> /<i>alyo</i>, Swahili <i>kitunguu</i><i>saumu</i>, Wolof <i>laaj</i>, Hausa <i>tafarnuwa</i>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0584_leek"/>According to Zohary, supported by Moldenke, the Hebrew word <i>chatsir</i> in <s>00401100500040</s> refers to the True Leek <i>Allium porrum</i>, but Hepper argues that it is more likely the Salad Leek <i>Allium kurrat</i> (also known as Egyptian Leek), specimens of which have been found in Egyptian tombs. Moldenke and others hold that <i>chatsir</i> could also have been the Fenugreek <i>Trigonella foenum-graecum</i>, which was also known both in Egypt and in the Holy Land. The word <i>chatsir</i> occurs elsewhere in the Old Testament with the meaning of “grass,” “herb” or “hay,” so it could be a generic word for any edible green plant (see <l target="FLORA:5.1.2">5.1.2 Grass</l>). However, in the context of “onions” and “garlics,” it is likely to refer to the leek. Zohary suggests that <i>chatsir</i> first referred to a specific plant and became a general word later.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0089_broadbean"/>Commentators and translators are unanimous in identifying the Hebrew word <i>pol</i> as the Broad Bean <i>Vicia faba</i> or <i>Faba vulgaris</i>. Beans were cultivated in the Middle East for millennia, and they probably originated there. No wild species are now known, and it is quite possible that the ancestors of the bean are extinct. Samples of beans have been found in excavations at Jericho dating to 7,000–8,000 years ago.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The broad bean is an erect plant, not a vine, reaching to 1 meter (3 feet) in height. The stem branches only in the upper part. It has no tendrils like many types of bean have today. The flowers are white, and when they ripen, they form pods containing 3–6 large flat beans of a cream or tan color.</Paragraph>

Since beans and peas are known around the world, translators will probably be able to find a local equivalent. In both contexts (2 Samuel and Ezekiel) the word is used in a list of items, and if a local species of bean is not available to the translator, a transliteration should be used (for example, Arabic <i>adas</i>; French <i>faverole</i>, <i>fève</i>, <i>haricot</i>; Spanish <i>frijol</i>; Portuguese <i>fava</i>, <i>favarola</i>, <i>feijão</i>; Swahili <i>haragwe</i>; Latin <i>vicia</i>).</Paragraph>

So Zohary advocates translating <i>chamits</i> as “chickpeas.” The choice is between two interpretations of <i>chamits</i>, one favored by cognate evidence, the other by traditional exegesis. In the excavation of Jericho, chickpeas were found dating from at least 2000 <a>B.C.</a>, well before the time of Isaiah, but archeologists claim to have found chickpeas on other sites in the Middle East also, some dating to 7000 <a>B.C.</a> Wild species found growing in the northern part of the Fertile Crescent have led botanists to believe that the chickpea originated there.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The context here is rhetorical, so if the translator understands <i>chamits</i> to mean “chickpeas,” it may be effective to use a cultural equivalent, preferably a plant that local farm animals would find delicious. Some translators, lacking a specific word for chickpeas, will need to use a generic term or phrase. If a transliteration from a major language is desired, consider Arabic <i>hummus</i>; French <i>pois</i><i>chiche</i>, <i>cicerole</i>; Portuguese <i>graão</i><i>de</i><i>bico</i>; and Spanish <i>garbanzo</i>. If, on the other hand, the alternative meaning of <i>chamits</i> is taken, a simple phrase such as “good food,” “best food” or “mixed food” is acceptable.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0093_lentils_red"/>Scholars are agreed that the Hebrew word <i>‘adashah</i> refers to the Lentil <i>Lens culinaris</i> (formerly known as <i>Lens esculenta</i>). The Arabic word <i>‘adas</i>, as well as several references in post-biblical Hebrew, confirm this identification, as does the Septuagint. Seeds found in excavations dating to the sixth or seventh millennium <a>B.C.</a> show that the lentil is one of the first species to be cultivated by humans. In those excavations lentils are often found together with seeds of wheat and barley.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0586_lentilplant"/>The lentil is a low-branched plant with a weak stem. It has tendrils, like pumpkins and squashes, and pinkish flowers that develop into a pod like a bean. The pod is very short with only one seed inside, about the size of a small pea. In one type of lentil the pea is reddish brown, hence the reference to “red” stew in <s>00102503001000</s>. The pods are often in pairs or sets of three. In the Holy Land lentils grow in the cold season (November-March).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In <s>02600400900022</s> the strange bread, made from six kinds of grains and legumes including lentils, was probably intended to show that food would become scarce and that the people would have to eat whatever they could find. The lentil is typically used in soups and stews, as it was when Jacob used it to trick his brother Esau into giving up his rights as the firstborn son. Lentils were among the foodstuffs brought to David by local people when he was pursued by Absalom.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Lentils are now widespread in Asia, India, and North Africa. In places where they are not known, we suggest using the word for a local type of bean rather than a transliteration. However, in <s>02600400900022</s> “beans” are also mentioned, so a possible rendering for “beans and lentils” is “different kinds of beans.” In <s>00102503400018</s> a generic expression for “pottage of lentils” would be appropriate, such as “bean soup,” “bean stew” (<a>CEV</a>), or “vegetable soup” (<a>NCV</a>). If a transliteration from a major language is desired, consider Arabic <i>adas</i>; French <i>cristallin</i>, <i>lentille</i>; Spanish <i>lenteja</i>; Portuguese <i>lentilha</i>; and Swahili <i>adesi</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0660_muskmelon"/><a>RSV</a> renders the Hebrew words <i>qishshu’ah</i> and <i>miqshah</i> as “cucumber.” Against Moldenke and others, Zohary argues forcefully that these words refer to the Muskmelon <i>Cucumis melo</i>, and that “garden cucumbers did not exist in Egypt in biblical times” (page 86). Hepper concurs with this, as does <i>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible</i>. Confusingly, one narrow and curved type of muskmelon is called the “snake cucumber.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Cultivated muskmelons started out in and around Persia (now Iran) before moving into northern India, Kashmir, and Afghanistan. Although truly wild forms of <i>Cucumis melo</i> have not been found in those regions, several related wild species have been noted.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A picture of offerings presented at a funeral in Egypt around 2400 <a>B.C.</a> contains fruit that some experts take to be muskmelons. The Greeks appear to have known the fruit in the third century <a>B.C.</a>, and in the first century after Christ it was definitely described by the Roman philosopher Pliny, who said it was something new in Campania in Italy. The Greek physician Galen, in the second century <a>A.D.</a>, wrote of its medicinal qualities, and Roman writers of the third century gave directions for growing it and preparing it with spices for eating. The Chinese apparently did not know the muskmelon until it was introduced to their country around the beginning of the Christian Era from the regions west of the Himalayas.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0661_muskmelon_vine"/>The muskmelon vine has round leaves and tendrils and creeps along the ground like a pumpkin or cucumber. It has tendrils and yellow flowers that develop into a fruit 10–40 centimeters (4–16 inches) in diameter. The fruit becomes yellowish or light green when ripe. The muskmelon is so named because of the distinctive smell of its ripe fruits. “Musk” is a Persian word for a kind of perfume; “melon” is a French word, from the Latin <i>melopepo</i>, meaning “apple-shaped melon.” Latin took words of similar meaning from Greek.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Many varieties of muskmelon are known around the world in warm countries. If it is not known, it may be translated contextually. <s>00401100500024</s> is non-rhetorical, and a transliteration from a major language is recommended (for example, French <i>cantaloupe</i>, Spanish and Portuguese <i>cantalupo</i>, Arabic <i>abd el lawi</i>). However, the reference to the temporary shelter in the melon patch in <s>02300100800024</s> is metaphorical, so a cultural equivalent representing a lonely or abandoned place could be considered. In this verse translators should keep in mind its parallel images, which are “a booth in a vineyard” and “a besieged city.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02401000500006</s>: <a>RSV</a> renders the first line of this verse as “Their idols are like scarecrows [<i>tomer</i> in Hebrew] in a cucumber field [<i>miqshah</i> ].” Exegetical questions swallow up the botanical ones here, and they all hinge on the Hebrew words <i>tomer miqshah</i>, which could be understood to mean “a straight palm tree” (so <a>KJV</a>, <a>NKJV</a>, ancient Greek versions of Aquila and Theodosius), “a handcarved pillar” (so Keil and Delitzsch, McKane), or “a scarecrow in a cucumber/melon field” (so <a>RSV</a>, <a>GNB</a>, and most other English versions). The Septuagint does not have this phrase at all, so there is no help there. Keil and Delitzsch argue for taking <i>tomer miqshah</i> as a handcarved pillar since the word <i>miqshah</i> means “hammered work” in <s>00202501800012</s>, <s>00202503100012</s>, <s>00202503600014</s>. <a>KJV</a> has “upright as the palm tree” (similarly <a>NKJV</a>), based on the idea that the word <i>tomer</i> is a variant of <i>tamar</i>, the normal word for palm tree. <i>Tomer</i> also occurs in <s>00700400500010</s>, where it seems to be universally accepted as meaning “palm tree,” although no one can satisfactorily explain the unusual vowel pattern (<i>tomer</i> instead of <i>tamar</i>). See <l target="FLORA:2.5">2.5 Date palm</l>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Among the texts of <s>02401000500004</s> found at Qumran, 4QJera and 4QJerb do not have this line, but according to Lundbom, both Janzen and Tov believe that 4QJerb included something in that place that is now missing. According to Lundbom, it should begin with “It is worked silver, they will not walk,” which is similar to the reading in the Septuagint but with something added. In other words, Lundbom concludes that if we had a complete 4QJerb it would not have the words <i>tomer miqshah</i> and therefore would not help to resolve the issue of cucumber/melon patch versus palm tree or pillar.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The cucumber field interpretation has apparently been influenced by <s>07300106900008</s> (70), which begins with “Like a scarecrow in a cucumber bed, that guards nothing.” The Greek word <i>sikuēraton</i> (“cucumber bed”) may even be derived from the Hebrew word <i>qishshu’ah</i> by inversion of the first two consonants.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Most versions and commentators seem to favor the cucumber/melon patch interpretation rather than the palm tree or pillar interpretation. However, the evidence on the other side is such that I would suggest including it in a footnote that offers these alternatives: “a carved post” or “a carved palm tree.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If translators decide on the botanical interpretation of <i>miqshah</i>, they still have to decide what vegetable or fruit it was. Zohary strongly favors muskmelon and Hepper appears to agree. <a>NIV</a> says “a melon patch” (similarly <a>GNB</a>, <a>NCV</a>). <a>NLT</a> generalizes by saying “a garden.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0903_watermelon"/>Most scholars believe the Hebrew word <i>’avattiach</i> refers to the Common Watermelon <i>Citrullus vulgaris</i> /<i>lanatus</i>, and it should be so identified since there are other types of melons, such as the muskmelon, with which it should not be confused. In fact, until recently, some botanists thought that this word referred to the muskmelon. Watermelons probably originated in Africa (possibly in the Kalahari) and were probably domesticated in the Neolithic Period. They have been cultivated in Egypt since prehistoric times and are used for food, drink, and medicine. Even the seeds are eaten. The Arabic cognate <i>batekh</i> /<i>batikh</i> is used for both the muskmelon and the watermelon.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0105_caper"/>In the delightful description of old age in <s>02101200000000</s>, a string of metaphors is followed by the clause “desire [<i>’aviyonah</i> in Hebrew] fails.” The word <i>’aviyonah</i> only occurs once in the Bible, so there has been much debate over its meaning. The Septuagint translators took the first meaning of the word and rendered it “caper berry,” referring to the spicy tasting bud of a small bush (<i>Capparis spinosa</i>) common in the Middle East. The Syriac and the Vulgate have the same rendering, and so do <a>NAB</a> and <a>GECL</a>. <a>GW</a>, <a>JB</a>, and <a>NJPSV</a> are similar with “caper bush,” and so are <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> with “caper-buds.” <i>La Nouvelle Bible Segond</i> and <i>La Sainte Bible: Version Synodale</i> say simply “caper,” and <a>FRCL</a> uses the generic term “spices.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0106_caperbuds"/>Jews and others in ancient times used the caper berry and especially the pickled bud of the bush to increase the appetite, and the words meaning “desire” found in Greek and Hebrew dictionaries seems to be based on the association of capers and desire. In the Middle Ages Europeans considered the caper berry as an aphrodisiac; Moldenke does not find evidence that it was so used in ancient times.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A number of prominent botanists are convinced that the Hebrew word <i>’ezov</i> in the Pentateuch does not refer to the hyssop plant (so Septuagint) or even the marjoram (“Syrian hyssop”), but to the caper bush, which grows in Egypt and the Sinai Desert, where the Israelites were instructed to use it for the Passover ceremony. It also grows in the cracks of city walls, fitting the description of Solomon’s knowledge of botany as described in <s>01100501301032</s> (4.33). Some even say a stick from the caper bush would have been long enough to fit the reference in <s>04301902901020</s> (<i>hussōpos</i> in Greek), where soldiers lifted a sponge to Jesus’ lips on a stick. However, Zohary and others, on the basis of etymology, believe the words <i>’ezov</i> and <i>hussōpos</i> most likely refer to the marjoram plant. I agree. See also the discussion on these words under <l target="FLORA:5.2.4">5.2.4 Marjoram</l>.</Paragraph>

This process, called “pickling,” was already being done before the time of Christ in Israel, Egypt, and Arabia. Middle Easterners also ate the fruit of the caper bush, which was also spicy. Now pickled caper buds are popular throughout Europe, especially in France. Ancient Greek writers mention the caper often. It was used to get rid of stomach gas.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The caper bush is common throughout the Mediterranean region. Another species known as <i>Capparis sodado</i> grows in East Africa (Sudan), Arabia, and southern India. It is an almost leafless spiny shrub and has edible berries. Four other members of the genus <i>Capparis</i> are found in South America (mostly in Argentina, southern Brazil, Columbia, Paraguay, and Venezuela) with the names <i>Pan y agua</i> and <i>Sacha-poroto</i>. There the fruit is eaten but is apparently not as popular as the caper is in southern Europe. The reference to the caper in <s>02101200500042</s> is part of a long string of metaphors, so the translation of “caper” will depend on how the translators have dealt with “almond tree” and the other metaphors, either leaving them literal, or “domesticating” them by using local equivalents or a generic term. Our preference here would be to keep the language poetical by substituting a local plant with the same function, in this case, something that stimulates the taste buds. Here we want to express the old person’s inability to enjoy spicy food. If the translation is to be more literal, an English transliteration could be used by rendering the whole clause as “the <i>kaparis</i> no longer makes you/him salivate [or, no longer bites/tickles],” with a footnote indicating that <i>kaparis</i> is a Jewish spice. Other transliterations could be made from Arabic <i>assaf</i>, <i>alkabara</i>; French <i>capre</i>; Portuguese <i>alcaparras</i>; and Spanish <i>alcaparron</i>, <i>caparra</i>. <a>RSV</a> says “desire fails,” which is a nonfigurative rendering of the Hebrew. If this option is followed, a footnote may be appreciated, stating that the Hebrew refers to a spicy food in this passage.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0148_coriander_flower"/>According to <s>00201603100024</s>, the miraculous food called “manna” that God sent to the wandering Israelites in the desert was “like coriander seed, white.” Coriander <i>Coriandrum sativum</i> did in fact grow in Egypt and the Holy Land. However, its seed is not very white, but more brown or gray, and the <s>00401100700012</s> tells us that the color was that of bdellium, of which we know almost nothing for certain. Further, the Septuagint has the Greek word <i>korion</i>, which is not coriander. The Arabic name <i>gidda</i>, the cognate of the Hebrew word <i>gad</i>, refers to a different plant, namely wormwood. To complicate the matter further, <s>00201601401000</s> describes manna as “flaky,” whereas coriander seeds are spherical or egg-shaped.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In view of these difficulties, Zohary expresses doubt as to whether the word <i>gad</i> actually refers to the plant we now know as coriander. He speculates that early translators, not knowing what <i>gad</i> referred to, took the Punic word <i>goid</i> for coriander, and made the association between <i>gad</i> and coriander. The writer would have done us a favor if he had said “like coriander flowers,” which can be white, but unfortunately the text has “seed.” Maybe an early narrator or scribe made a mistake in transmitting the text. Could the Hebrew word <i>perach</i> (“flower”) perhaps have been replaced by <i>zera‘</i> (“seed”)?</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However, it is possible that coriander seed really was intended, and that the point of comparison between manna and coriander seeds was their size, which is about 4 millimeters (3/16 inch) in diameter, the size of a peppercorn (black pepper seed). (Thus <a>REB</a> and <a>NAB</a> have “like coriander seed, but white.”) Another possibility is that the writer was thinking of the way the seeds cluster, or of their firmness. We are told in <s>00401100801000</s> that the people pounded the manna in mortars and ground it in mills, suggesting some degree of hardness.</Paragraph>

The seeds are oily, brown or gray, and about the size of small peas. The leaves and seeds were used in ancient times in cooking, and are still used for soup and salads up to the present.

            <Paragraph>As discussed above, coriander is used to describe the appearance of manna. Unfortunately we don’t know whether the point of comparison is the color, shape, size, or texture. Coriander is common in Israel and Egypt, and all the way across to Iraq and India. The leaves are used as a spice for food and also in perfume.

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><i>A Handbook on Exodus</i> says that it is the shape and size of the coriander seeds that are the point of comparison between coriander and manna, but since we are not sure, it may be difficult to find a cultural equivalent. So translators can give a generic rendering, as <a>GNB</a> has done (“like a small white seed”), omitting reference to coriander (but including it in a footnote). It is also possible to follow <a>REB</a> and <a>NAB</a> (“like coriander seed, but white”), which disassociate the seed from the color. If this is done, translators may transliterate “coriander” from a major language (for example, French <i>koriyandro</i>, <i>korion</i>; Arabic <i>kuzbara</i>; Portuguese <i>coentro</i>; Spanish <i>cilantro</i>) or from the Hebrew <i>gad</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Septuagint injects the Greek word for coriander (<i>korion</i>) from <s>00201603100024</s> back into verse 14. Some versions have followed this, but it is not particularly helpful.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Dill is known in western Asia and in India as well as in Europe and America. Depending on what is done with the other plants in <s>04002302300026</s>, namely mint and cumin, the translator may choose to transliterate “dill” from the original Greek <i>anēthon</i> or from a major language (for example, French <i>aneth</i>; Spanish <i>anega</i>, <i>eneldo</i>, <i>aneto</i>; Portuguese <i>endro</i>, <i>aneto</i>, <i>funcho</i>; Arabic <i>bazrul</i>, <i>shibit</i>, <i>sjama</i>). It is debatable whether the context here is rhetorical or not, so transliteration of the three species is acceptable, although substituting cultural equivalents is also possible and effective. It is important to keep in mind the parallel passage of <s>01200602500044</s>, which does not include dill. <i>An American Translation</i> (<a>AT</a>), <a>Mft</a>, and Weymouth use “dill” here, as do the modern English versions.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0835_star_of_bethlehem_plant"/>In the story of the siege of Samaria, we read in <s>01200602500044</s> that “the fourth part of a kab of dove’s dung [was sold] for five shekels of silver.” The Samarians must have been desparate, but even so, they were probably not eating dove’s dung, and three possibilities are given by the experts:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. The original writer wrote the Hebrew word <i>chartsonim</i> (“wild onion”) and the text was copied wrongly to read <i>chareyonim</i> (“dove’s dung”). <a>NJB</a> and <a>NAB</a> take this position.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. Dove’s dung was the name of a common plant (footnotes in <a>GNB</a> and <a>NLT</a>). Possible candidates for the plant called “dove’s dung” are:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>a. locust bean, or carob (<a>NIV</a>, <a>REB</a>, <a>NJPSV</a> footnote);</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>b. the bulb of a flower (Linnaeus, Josephus).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. Real dove’s dung was processed and made into a salt substitute (footnote in <a>GECL</a> [1982]).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Hepper doubts that dove’s dung would refer to the carob or locust bean. He finds option 2b more likely, saying that <i>chareyonim</i> refers to the bulbs of the Star of Bethlehem <i>Ornithogalum narbonense</i>, which, according to historians, were sold during the siege of Samaria at about two ounces of silver for a cup. The name Linnaeus gave to the Star of Bethlehem plant is “ornitho-galum.” This name literally means bird-milk, suggesting that the botanist was perhaps aware of the connection to a name like “bird dung.” Only one of the many species of the genus <i>Ornithogalum</i> is edible; all the others are poisonous. Having lived in Nigeria where the leaf of a plant called “bird dung” is a popular soup ingredient (called <i>kashin tsuntsu</i> in Hausa), I am prepared to believe option 2. Anderson, Zohary, and Hareuveni do not mention “dove’s dung,” perhaps on the assumption that it is not a plant.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0836_star_of_bethlehem_flower"/>The Star of Bethlehem plant grows to about 25 centimeters (10 inches) from a circular bunch of narrow leaves at the base. Its sweet-smelling white flowers have six petals and grow on a stalk. They appear late in the spring and last only about 2 weeks before wilting. The flowers open in the morning and usually close by noon.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Whatever “dove’s dung” may be in <s>01200602500044</s>, it was intended to illustrate the desperate condition of the inhabitants of Samaria during the siege, when even something barely edible was sold at an exorbitant price.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>For “dove’s dung” the name of some marginally edible market item, or a phrase such as “wild onions” would be appropriate in <s>01800600600024</s>. The use of a commonly used measurement and coin instead of “kab” and “shekel” will help get the point across. The parallelism of “dove’s dung” with “donkey’s head” will also help, as long as the value of the silver is expressed meaningfully. If the translator substitutes a local object for “dove’s dung,” it should be a very low-value commodity. The Septuagint translated “dove’s dung” literally. Those who wish to follow a literal rendering, as in <a>RSV</a> and <a>NLT</a>, should have a footnote stating that “dove’s dung” could be a plant. Possibilities for transliteration are French <i>ornithogale</i>, <i>aspergette</i>; Portuguese <i>ornitogalos</i>; and Spanish <i>ornitogala</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0736_purslane_plant"/>Responding to the unhelpful and unkind words of his so-called friends, Job asks the following in <s>01800600600024</s>: “Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt? Is there any taste in the slime of the purslane [<i>challamuth</i> in Hebrew]?” The main ideas of these two parallel lines are: a) tasteless things need salt, and b) the slime of <i>challamuth</i> is tasteless.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There is much debate whether or not the Hebrew word <i>challamuth</i> refers to a plant at all here. Some versions render it as “white of an egg” (<a>GNB</a>, <a>NLT</a>, <a>GW</a>) or “egg white” (<a>NIV</a>), and one commentator suggests it could refer to “whitewash,” “plaster,” or even “one who has died.” However, on the basis of Arabic cognate word <i>lachamut</i> and the Mishnaic tradition, Zohary holds that <i>challamuth</i> may refer to one or more plants from the <i>Malvaceae</i> family, namely Mallow <i>Malva sylvestris</i>, Mallow <i>Malva nicaeensis</i>, or Hollyhock <i>Alcea setosa</i>. <a>REB</a> has “mallow.” Some species in this family are in fact eaten by goats and are used by Bedouins in cooking.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>However, Hepper identifies <i>challamuth</i> as the Common Purslane <i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, another plant used in salad and as medicine. Moldenke does not find a plant at all in <s>01800600600024</s>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>If the word <i>challamuth</i> refers to a plant, it is one that represents something tasteless and slimy in <s>01800600600024</s>.

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><s>01800600600024</s>: Given the wide range of opinion among the experts, the translator’s simplest option for rendering <i>challamuth</i> is to follow a major version used in the area. Since the context is rhetorical, translators striving for poetic impact may look for a cultural equivalent—a plant that is known to be tasteless, or something else unpleasant like a raw egg white.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>An important question here is this: Is <i>challamuth</i> something totally inedible, or is it something that is edible if you put salt on it? In Africa, where okra and roselle are well known (and slimy), such a plant could be used. However, translators should be careful since both okra and rosella are eaten frequently in soup and are considered delicious! <i>A Handbook on The Book of Job</i> gives about equal weight to “purslane,” “mallow,” “milkweed,” and “egg white,” and finally commends “egg white” as in <a>GNB</a>. However, if translators wish to take <i>challamuth</i> as a plant, we offer the following basic models based on two alternative assumptions:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. If the Hebrew words <i>tafel</i> (“that which is tasteless”) and <i>rir challamuth</i> (“slime of the purslane”) refer to totally inedible substances, two possible renderings of <s>01800600601000</s> are:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>“No one could swallow what I have been given to eat. It is like plaster, like the sap of milkweed [or, euphorbia cactus / mallow].”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>“No one can eat whitewash [or, plaster/sand/straw/cotton]. There is no taste in milkweed sap [or, euphorbia sap].”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. If these Hebrew words refer to edible but tasteless substances, two possible models are:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>“No one could swallow what I have been given to eat. It is like pap [or, raw cassava or some local very plain food without much taste] without salt, like the sap of mallow [or, the juice of some tasteless but edible plant].”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>“No one can eat pap [or, raw cassava or some local flat-tasting food such as rice] without salt. There is no taste in the sap of mallow [or, the juice of some tasteless but edible plant.]”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Any of these renderings prepare the reader for Job’s next line: “My appetite refuses to touch them.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01802402400018</s>: According to <a>HOTTP</a>, the Hebrew word <i>kakol</i> rendered “like the mallow” can either mean “like all” or “like the umbel.” (An umbel is a flower cluster that has a common axis.) If it is true that the Hebrew verb following <i>kakol</i> actually means “to close up,” then “umbel” is odd because umbellate flowers, to my knowledge, do not “close up.” So, if translators follow <a>HOTTP</a> here, the meaning “like all” is recommended. <a>NIV</a> follows this sense by rendering the second line of this verse as “they are brought low and gathered up like all others” (similarly <a>LB</a>, <a>NAB</a>, Wolfers).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Septuagint translates <i>kol</i> as the plant called “saltwort,” according to Pope. If one normally follows the Septuagint, “saltwort” is preferable to “mallow.” If a transliteration from English is necessary, “saltwort” (<a>NJB</a>) or “saltplant” is more technically correct than “mallow” (<a>RSV</a>, <a>NJPSV</a>). See <l target="FLORA:3.5.10">3.5.10 Orache (saltwort)</l>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><a>GNB</a> and <a>CEV</a> render <i>kol</i> as “weeds” to avoid the issue of the identity of the plant, but of course this rendering loses some color in its generality.</Paragraph>

The Jews called it <i>dandanah</i>, a Hebrew word that does not occur in the Old Testament.

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0662_white_mustard"/>There is by no means full agreement about the precise identity of the plant in Jesus’ famous references to the mustard seed. Two types of mustard grow in the Holy Land and probably grew there in Bible times: Black Mustard <i>Brassica nigra</i> and White Mustard <i>Sinapis alba</i>. Zohary and Moldenke favor the former. Hepper leaves it open. Both species were either cultivated or gathered in Bible times, probably more for the oil, which was used in medicine and cooking, than as a spice. Both types are cultivated today.</Paragraph>

They are planted and harvested each year. They grow to 2 meters (7 feet) in height and have branches like a tree. At the ends of the branches there are bright yellow flowers with four petals, like nearly all the members of the <i>Brassicaceae</i> family. The seeds are small among the seeds of garden plants, being about 2 millimeters (1/12 inch) in diameter, but they are not by any means the smallest of all seeds.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>At least thirty kinds of mustard are known in the world, twenty-one of them in Europe. Others are found in Northeast Africa, India, Japan, and China. The quality in focus in all of the Gospel references is the smallness of the mustard seed compared to the large size of the resulting plant. The translator must keep that in mind, even if a relative of the mustard is found. If no effective equivalent is available, it will be necessary to transliterate “mustard” from a major language (for example, French <i>moutarde</i>, Spanish <i>mostaza</i>, Portuguese <i>mostarda</i>, Arabic <i>khardal</i><i>aswad</i>, Swahili <i>haradali</i>).</Paragraph>

It has been rendered “fitches” (<a>KJV</a>), “dill” (<a>RSV</a>, <a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, <a>NEB</a>, <a>REB</a>), “fennel” (<a>JB</a>, <a>NJB</a>), and “caraway” (<a>NIV</a>). Against all of these renderings, Zohary confidently asserts that the word <i>qetsach</i> refers to the Nigella plant <i>Nigella sativa</i>, also called by the names nutmeg flower, black cumin, black seed, charnushka, and kalonji. (The Hebrew word <i>kammon</i> in these verses refers to the ordinary cumin; see <l target="FLORA:3.5.3">3.5.3 Cumin (cummin)</l>) Hepper agrees, apparently supported by Post, Moldenke, and others. The Aramaic and Arabic equivalent is <i>qatscha</i>. Jews, Arabs, and Europeans use nigella seeds to decorate cakes and bread up to the present. It is also used as a spice in cooking.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Nigella is used by Isaiah as one of several species in a parable he tells to the leaders of Israel. A farmer, he says, does not destroy the results of one season’s work while preparing for that of the next season. This is spoken to know-it-all scoffers who claim that God’s ways are completely fixed. Against that Isaiah says that God’s ways are according to the conditions of his creatures, as a farmer plants and harvests according to the needs of the various crops.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The abundance of names for nigella is an indication of its popularity around the world. Fortunately the Latin name <i>nigella</i> is now replacing the confusing name “black cumin.” This is good because cumin is a totally different plant. Likewise, “nutmeg flower” and “black caraway” are losing favor. So translators can avoid the confusion brought on by the English by transliterating from Latin (<i>nigella</i>), French and Dutch (<i>nigelle</i>), Spanish (<i>agenuz</i>, <i>neguilla</i>, <i>arañuel</i>), German (<i>Nigella</i>, <i>Schwartzkümmel</i> [literally “black seed”]), Hebrew (<i>qetsach</i>), Persian (<i>kalanji</i>), or Arabic (<i>habbet as suda</i>, <i>kamun aswad</i>, <i>shuniz</i>). In Amharic nigella is <i>tikur azmud</i>, in Mandarin <i>hei zhong cao</i>, and in Indonesian <i>jinten hitam</i>.</Paragraph>

Although a few botanists render <i>malluach</i> as “mallow” (so <a>RSV</a>), Zohary, following Moldenke and others, holds that <i>malluach</i> refers to the Shrubby Orache <i>Atriplex halimus</i>, also called saltbush. The Septuagint uses the Greek word <i>halimōn</i> (coming from <i>halmē</i> “salted”), which refers to a species of saltwort or orache. Orache is abundant especially in salty areas in the desert and on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea. If we follow the Septuagint, orache or saltwort is also appropriate in <s>01802402400018</s> (see <l target="FLORA:3.5.6">3.5.6 Mallow</l>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Given the uncertainty of the identification of the Hebrew word <i>malluach</i>, translators may be excused for taking a generic route here and translating “coarse leaves” (<a>NLT</a>), “tasteless shrubs” (<a>CEV</a>), “desert plants,” (<a>NCV</a>), or “plants of the desert” (<a>GNB</a>). <a>NIV</a> says “salt herbs,” which makes reference to the salt-tolerant nature of the orache reflected in the Septuagint and in the alternative name “saltwort.” However, it is equally appropriate to supply a species name here, and if the translator is so inclined, a transliteration of “orache” can be made from a major language (for example, English <i>orash</i>, French <i>arroche</i>), or a word like “saltbush” can be coined. “Mallow” should be not be used, since it refers to a different plant found in <s>01800600600024</s> (see <l target="FLORA:3.5.6">3.5.6 Mallow</l>).</Paragraph>

The very similar cultivated rue <i>Ruta graveolens</i> was introduced from southern Europe later. Rue is common throughout the Middle East, from Syria to Sinai up to the present. Because of its strong smell it is used in cooking and in medicine up to the present. It was used by the Greeks, Romans, and Jews against snakebite and the stings of bees, wasps and scorpions, not to mention its effectiveness against insanity, epilepsy, and even “the evil eye.” In post-biblical Jewish literature rue is called <i>pigam</i>, which is cognate with the Greek <i>pēganon</i> and the Arabic <i>fegan</i>.</Paragraph>

It is possible that the disagreement between Jesus and the Pharisees arose because by New Testament times the people were cultivating rue, dill, and similar plants that had not been cultivated before, and the Pharisees then applied the laws of the Talmud to these little plants, thus complicating the lives of the common people, while at the same time they ignored issues of justice and compassion.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The Bible contains a wide and perplexing number of references to substances used for incense, anointing oil, perfume, and medicine. Many plants were in fact used for both incense and medicine. Sweet-smelling goods were an important element of Middle Eastern life in Bible times, as is shown by the fact that Ishmaelites in <s>00103702501000</s> were carrying “gum, balm, and myrrh” down to Egypt, and Jacob sent the same goods with his sons as a gift to Pharaoh (<s>00104301101000</s>). Cassia and calamus are listed as trade goods from Syria in <s>02602701901000</s>, and <s>04000201101000</s> tells us that scholar-kings brought frankincense and myrrh from the East to Jerusalem. Still others are listed in <s>06601801302000</s>. In <s>00203002301000-00203002501000</s> God instructs Moses to take the finest spices and make anointing oil to anoint the priests. Incense was integral to worship, both pagan and Jewish. Spices were also used in embalming, as we know from the story of Jesus’ burial.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Spices come from a variety of sources. Some are lumps of hardened sap (gum, resin) from shrubs; others are the dried leaves or flowers of plants; still others are from the wood or roots of trees. We divide the sixteen plants covered here into two groups: 1) incense and perfume, and 2) balm and ointment. A number of items—gall, henbane, poison hemlock, wormwood and mandrake—do not quite fit in. We will deal with those in Chapter 5.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Before considering the various species, let us take a moment to deal with some generic issues, first in English and then in the biblical languages. The English word “spice” refers primarily to substances that give flavor to food such as cinnamon or pepper. However, when we speak of the “spice trade” we usually include all sorts of other substances that may be used for medicine, perfume, and incense as well.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The English word “balm” can refer to “any of various aromatic resinous substances used for healing and soothing” (<i>New Oxford American Dictionary</i>). However, it is also used more specifically to refer to medicinal oil that comes from various tropical trees, and especially those of the genus <i>Commiphora</i>. One of these is the Balsam or Opobalsamum <i>Commiphora gileadensis</i>, from which we get the shortened name “balm.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Related to the above is the fact that in many languages, a tree may have a different name from the substance it produces. For example, “mastic” comes from the lentisk tree and “ladanum” comes from the rock rose. “Stacte” comes from several kinds of trees, and “storax” comes from the Oriental sweetgum. Stacte and storax are often used interchangeably, as are storax and styrax by some writers, although we distinguish the two in this book.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>As for generic terms in Hebrew, in <s>00203002301000-00203002501000</s> God instructs Moses to take the finest “spices” (<i>bosem</i>) to make anointing oil. Zohary (page 198) describes the Hebrew word <i>bosem</i> as originally the name of a specific shrub (<i>Commiphora gileadensis</i>) but later it referred to all species of the genus <i>Commiphora</i> and their products. Does <i>bosem</i> refer to dry or liquid substances in this passage? Durham favors dry substances on the grounds that the measurement is in weight rather than volume. However, it could also have been a mixture consisting of the dry ingredients pulverized and mixed in with the liquid ones and the oil. Most English versions of this passage translate <i>bosem</i> as a cover term for the four specific substances that follow: <i>mor deror</i> (“liquid myrrh”), <i>qinnemon besem</i> (“sweet-smelling cinnamon”), <i>qeneh bosem</i> (“aromatic cane”), and <i>qiddah</i> (“cassia”). In translating this passage, a general word or phrase such as “sweet-smelling spices” is recommended for <i>bosem</i>. <i>Bosem</i> and its derivatives (<i>basam</i>, <i>besem</i>) occur at least thirty times in the Bible.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A related generic Hebrew word that may cause problems for translators is <i>sam</i> in <s>00203003401016</s>, where Moses is given the formula for incense. The English versions use various expressions for <i>sam</i> in this verse; for example, “sweet spices” (<a>RSV</a>, <a>GNB</a>), “fragrant spices” (<a>NIV</a>, <a>REB</a>), “aromatic substances” (<a>NAB</a>), “herbs” (<a>NJPSV</a>), and “costly spices” (<a>CEV</a>). This general word for spices introduces the four substances that made up the incense burned in the Tabernacle, namely <i>nataf</i> (“stacte”), <i>shecheleth</i> (“onycha”), <i>chelbenah</i> (“galbanum”), and <i>levonah</i> (“frankincense”), which will be dealt with below. The word <i>sam</i> occurs sixteen times in the Old Testament.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>tsori</i> is translated “balm” in <a>RSV</a>, but Zohary takes it to refer to a specific plant, namely the Storax <i>Liquidambar orientalis</i>, and Moldenke takes it to be the Egyptian balsam (see <l target="FLORA:4.2.3">4.2.3 Liquidambar (Oriental sweetgum, storax)</l>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>bedolach</i> is problematic. It occurs in <s>00100201200020</s> and <s>00401100700026</s>, where <a>RSV</a>, <a>NCV</a>, <a>GW</a>, and <a>NJPSV</a> transliterate it as “bdellium.” Botanists have generally held that this Hebrew word does not refer to a plant product. However, a surprising number of versions render it “resin” or “perfume” with one qualifying word or another (so <a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, <a>REB</a>). The Septuagint used the Greek word <i>anthrax</i>, which is a red stone (for example, carbuncle). <a>Mft</a> says “pearls.” Perhaps the safest course is to transliterate <i>bedolach</i>, with or without footnoting other possibilities.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Generic Greek words for spices include <i>arōma</i> (<s>04101600100032</s>; <s>04202305600008</s>; <s>04202400100030</s>; <s>04301904000026</s>; <s>07102401500010</s>) and <i>amōmon</i> (<s>06601801300008</s>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0016_agarwood"/>Zohary confidently identifies the Hebrew word <i>’ahaloth</i> in <s>01904500900006</s> (8) as referring to the Agarwood or Eaglewood <i>Aquillaria agallocha</i>, which is a tree native to northern India. (He also says it is native to East Africa, but this seems to be a mistake). The ancient Greek writer Dioscorides calls the eaglewood <i>agallochon</i>, a wood found in India and Arabia. This view is supported by Anderson and the commentators Snaith and Budd. Hepper, who is generally suspicious of claims about trade with the Far East in this period of history, doubts this identification but goes along with it for lack of an alternative. The chips of the wood are sold in India under the name <i>agar</i> (Hepper, page 140) and burned as incense. Expeditions like those of King Solomon (<s>01100902601000-01100902801000</s>) may have brought this precious commodity from India by way of mysterious places like Tema (<s>01800601901000</s>) or Dedan (<s>02302101301000</s>), possibly in the Arabian Peninsula.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>00402400600018</s> the Hebrew word <i>’ahalim</i> does not refer to the fragrant chips of the agarwood tree, but the actual trees. The last two lines of this verse read “like aloes [<i>’ahalim</i> ] that the <a>LORD</a> has planted, like cedar trees beside the waters.” These parallel lines suggest verdant growth. If the agarwood trees actually grew only in the Far East, what would Balaam or the writer of Numbers know about how they looked? Budd and others suggest that in this verse various elements of nature are combined in an exotic vision of luxury and beauty. <a>Mft</a> renders <i>’ahalim</i> as “oaks,” assuming that a Middle Eastern species was intended. Moldenke approves of this.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The agarwood tree is also known as lignaloes or aloeswood, but it has no relation whatever to the True Aloe <i>Aloe vera</i> that is native to the Middle East, Madagascar, and southern Africa (see <l target="FLORA:4.2.1">4.2.1 Aloe (bitter aloe)</l>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0018_agarwoodlog"/>Apart from the unusual reference in Numbers, all the references to agarwood pair it with myrrh, confirming its function as a fragrant substance used in incense and perfumes. Traditionally old agarwood trees were cut down in order to find the resinous wood in the center of the tree. Now, due to the serious decline in the number of trees, people in Thailand, Bhutan and other Southeast Asian countries have found ways to induce younger trees to produce the resin. This resin has been a highly valued part of both Buddhist and Islamic ceremonies for many centuries, as well as being used for perfume and for medicine. Embalmers in ancient Egypt used agarwood along with other spices. Japanese people use it with sandalwood in their incense ceremony (<i>koh-do</i>).</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Since the agarwood tree is well known in East Africa and India (Sanskrit <i>aghal</i>), translators in these areas should be able to find the local name. In Arabic agarwood is called <i>oud</i> (“wood”), the name used also by perfumers in Europe, but it is rarely seen because of its high cost. The tree is called <i>jin-koh</i> in Japanese, <i>chen-xiang</i> in Chinese, and <i>gaharu</i> in Indonesian. Elsewhere, translators will need to consider how they deal with the word pair myrrh and agar. If “myrrh” is transliterated, then “agar” could also be transliterated. In Asia the tree takes its name from the product (agar). In <s>01904500900006 02000701700008 02200401400026</s>, it is the name of the substance that would be transliterated (“agar”), not the tree (“agarwood”). It could be argued that these passages are rhetorical, and translators are thereby free to seek cultural equivalents for myrrh and agar. Balaam’s blessing of Israel in <s>00402400600018</s>, though rhetorical and even perhaps fanciful, is a more complicated case, since it pairs agarwood trees with cedars, which are also cited prominently in non-rhetorical contexts. There the translator will need to choose between being historically and geographically accurate and being rhetorically effective.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0099_calamus"/>The Hebrew word <i>qaneh</i> /<i>qeneh</i> means “cane” or “stalk”; <i>tov</i> means “good”; <i>bosem</i> means “spicy.” There are three general options for the identity of <i>qaneh</i>. Many botanists have held that this word refers to any of three or four sweet-smelling grasses of the genus <i>Cymbopogon</i>, one of which grows wild in Israel. That would be one option. Another is that it was imported from India, where other fragrant types of <i>Cymbopogon</i> were and are cultivated, such as Ginger Grass <i>Cymbopogon martinii</i>, Camel Grass <i>Cymbopogon schoenanthrus</i>, and Lemon Grass <i>Cymbopogon citratus</i>. Of these, Zohary and Moldenke both favor “ginger grass,” which is also called “sweet calamus.” However, the real Calamus <i>Acorus calamus</i> is a third possibility. It is a reed-like plant, more popularly known as the “sweet flag.” The origin of this plant is hotly debated, but it may have started from India and spread in marshy ground across Europe, picking up names like flagroot, myrtle flag, myrtle sedge, sweet root, and sweet sedge. The Egyptologist Joret believes it was used by the Pharaohs. The botanist Burkill holds that the Greeks used the ginger-like roots of the sweet flag, but confused them with the roots of the true ginger grass, leaving a legacy of confusion behind them (Hepper, page 144).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The references to <i>qaneh</i> in <s>02304302400014</s> and <s>02400602000018</s> are arguably rhetorical. Local cultural equivalents could be sought in those passages, keeping in mind that in both places <i>qaneh</i> is paired with frankincense. Translators may feel it best to deal with both of them the same way. If so, a generic word for grass or reed may be used together with a word meaning “fragrant” to render <i>qaneh</i>. Translators from Asia will probably find local names for ginger grass or lemon grass. Alternatively, the translator could transliterate from Greek (<i>kalamos</i>) with or without the word for “sweet.” Since the extract of calamus/ginger grass is an oil, one could translate “sweet-smelling kalamos oil.” Translators can also consider transliterating from a major language (for example, French <i>verveine</i>, <i>citronelle</i>; Portuguese <i>erva</i> -<i>cideira</i>; Spanish <i>limonaria</i>, <i>paja</i><i>de</i><i>Meca</i>, <i>Pasto cetron</i>, <i>Zacate lemon</i>, <i>palmarosa</i>; Chinese <i>shihch'ang pu</i>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0112_cassia"/>As in the case of agarwood above (<l target="FLORA:4.1.1">4.1.1</l>), Zohary is confident that the substance referred to by the Hebrew words <i>qiddah</i> and <i>qetsi‘ah</i> is oil or powder derived from the leaves, twigs, or bark of the Cassia <i>Cinnamomum cassia</i>, a tree found in East Asia. The name “cassia” may possibly come from the Khasi people of northeastern India and Bangladesh; earlier they lived in the area of Assam and Burma and were involved in the ancient cassia trade. So cassia oil may have been brought into Israel from East Asia. However, with respect to “cassia” and “cinnamon” in <s>00203002300024 00203002400004</s>, Hepper argues that these spices were probably not Asian spices as has often been supposed. Quoting research by Lucas and Harris on ancient Egyptian materials, he says that there is no evidence of these Asian spices in tombs in Egypt (Hepper, page 138). If they were being transported by the deprived Israelites, why were they not used by the more prosperous Egyptians? Further, how was Moses to have access to these substances in remote Sinai? Hepper favors southern Arabia and northeastern Africa as sources for fragrant barks and resins. Note the caravans of Tema and Dedan (<s>01800601901000</s>; <s>02302101301000 02302101401000</s>) and the visit of the Queen of Sheba (<s>01101000201000</s>).</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Cassia is closely related to the well-known spice, cinnamon. In fact, much of the “cinnamon” sold in North America is cassia. Europeans and South Americans tend to use the real cinnamon from Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Since cassia is native to East Asia, translators there will know it by a local name, for example, <i>kayu manis cina</i> (Indonesian), <i>kaeseo</i> (Korean), <i>ob choey chin</i> / <i>thephatharo</i> (Thai), and <i>que don</i> / <i>que quang</i> (Vietnamese). Chinese has at least ten names for it, including <i>guan gui</i> and <i>gui xin</i>. It is cultivated there for its bark, buds, and oil. Since the passages that refer to cassia are non-rhetorical, translators elsewhere may transliterate this term from a major language (for example, Arabic <i>darsini</i>, <i>kirfa</i>, <i>karfa</i>, <i>salika</i>; French <i>kas</i>, <i>kanéfis</i>, <i>kanel</i><i>de</i><i>chin</i> /<i>selon</i>; Spanish/Portuguese <i>cassia</i>, <i>canela de la China</i>). Cassia is of the genus <i>Cinnamomum</i>, which is completely different from the genus <i>Cassia</i> of which there are many species in Africa. So transliterations based on “cassia” are potentially misleading in Africa. To avoid a wrong association with African cassia (which is not aromatic), African translators could do one of the following:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. transliterate from the Hebrew <i>qiddah</i>;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. transliterate from English (<i>kasiya</i>) and write a footnote saying this tree has no relationship to the cassia tree of Africa;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. substitute a well-known sweet-smelling gum.</Paragraph>
          </Paragraphs>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0132_cinnamonleaf"/>True Cinnamon <i>Cinnamomum verum</i> (or <i>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</i>) is a tree found mostly in Sri Lanka, India, and Burma. The Hebrew word <i>qinnamon</i> may ultimately derive from an early form of the Malaysian/Indonesian expression <i>kayu</i><i>manis</i>, meaning “sweet wood.” As in the case of cassia, there is debate about whether the cinnamon mentioned in the Old Testament could have been imported from the Far East or whether there was perhaps a spice from Arabia or Africa that was named <i>qinnamon</i>, because this name was known at the time of writing. Some scholars believe that there was trade between India and Egypt as early as the second millennium <a>B.C.</a> In fact, the renowned Egyptian queen Hatshepsut is thought to have brought myrrh or frankincense trees from “Punt,” which could have been Somalia or even India, in 1490 <a>B.C.</a> However, she apparently did not bring cinnamon trees, nor are cinnamon and cassia among the spices found in the tombs of Egypt. So the true identity of the biblical cinnamon is still in question.</Paragraph>

The leathery leaves are 10–15 centimeters (4–6 inches) in length and have three light-colored, radiating veins. The spongy outer bark is scraped off, revealing a fragrant pale brown inner bark. This inner bark carries the cinnamon flavor. It is cut off and dried, and the bark curls to form little scrolls. The small flowers have an unpleasant smell.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Translators in Asia will be able to use their own word for cinnamon (for example, Mandarin <i>rou gui</i>, <i>xi lan rou gui</i>; Korean <i>kye</i> / <i>kyepi</i>, <i>sillon-gyepi</i>; Malay <i>kayu manis</i>; Nepali <i>dalchini</i>; Tamil <i>lavanga pattai</i>; Thai <i>ob</i><i>choey</i>; Vietnamese <i>cay que</i> / <i>nhuc que</i>, <i>que ranh</i>). They will even be able to distinguish between cassia and cinnamon. In other areas it is best to transliterate from Hebrew <i>qinnamon</i> or a major language (for example, English <i>sinamon</i>; French <i>kanel</i>; Spanish/Portuguese <i>kanela</i>; Arabic <i>kirfa</i>, <i>darini</i>, <i>salika</i>). Since the bark was ground into powder, the words “bark” or “powder” may be useful as classifiers. In <s>00203002300024 00203002401004</s> translators will need two words for the closely related cassia and cinnamon.</Paragraph>

It has fine, shiny leaflets, a thick smooth stem, and a flower head like an umbrella. The seeds are shiny and very small. The plant has a milky juice that comes out by itself from the joints or oozes out from the stem when it is cut. It forms aromatic greenish or yellowish beads when it dries. The taste is bitter and the smell is strong. A kind of fennel grows in Galilee (<i>Ferula communis</i>), but it does not yield the galbanum resin. Another kind, known from Roman coins from Carthage, grew in North Africa under the name <i>silphion</i> (probably <i>Ferula tingitana</i>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0244_frankincense_branch"/>Frankincense <i>Boswellia sacra</i> is a yellow or reddish gum produced by one of the fifteen aromatic species of <i>Boswellia</i>. It was probably imported into Israel from Arabia, Africa, or Asia. Egyptian pictorial records indicate that Queen Hatshepsut travelled to a place called “Punt” (possibly Somalia or even India) and brought back specimens that look like Boswellia trees, planting them in her palace garden. According to Hepper, gum from the Somalian (<i>Boswellia carteri</i>), Ethiopian (<i>Boswellia papyrifera</i>), and Arabian (<i>Boswellia sacra</i>) types would have been used at first, but later, Indian kinds (<i>Boswellia serrata</i>) might have been available. Some people call frankincense <i>olibanum</i> (a Middle Eastern word meaning “incense”), but it is possible that <i>olibanum</i> may properly refer only to <i>Boswellia serrata</i> from India, which has a lemon/lime smell as opposed to the orange smell of true frankincense.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Today the best frankincense is reputed to come from Oman, but Yemen and Somalia also produce a lot of it. The name <i>olibanum</i> may come from the Arabic <i>al-lubán</i> (milk) or from the equivalent of “oil of Lebanon.” The Hebrew word <i>levonah</i> can mean either “white” or “Lebanese.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Boswellia trees are actually shrubs reaching 3 meters (10 feet) in height, with multiple trunks coming from the ground. They have pinnate leaves and small greenish or white flowers. The gum of Boswellia trees comes out by itself in little drops from the branches and twigs, but it can also be extracted by cutting through the bark of the trunk. The resin appears in globs and hardens.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>A classifier will be useful if available (for example, “resin of”). Transliterations of the word for frankincense from Hebrew (<i>labona</i>, <i>lebonahi</i>), Greek (<i>libano</i>), French (<i>bosweli</i>, <i>olibán</i>), or Arabic (<i>akor</i>, <i>mager</i>, <i>mogar</i>) will be more readable than those from English (<i>firankinsensi</i>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>02400602000008</s> God says, “To what purpose does frankincense [<i>levonah</i> ] come to me from Sheba, or sweet cane [<i>qaneh hattov</i> ] from a distant land?” In this passage two plant derivatives (<i>levonah</i> and <i>qaneh hattov</i>) are used in rhetorical questions that both refer to incense. The rhetorical questions can be converted to positive statements by saying:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>It is useless for you to bring your <i>levonah</i> from Sheba.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Forget about your <i>qaneh hattov</i> from faraway lands.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In a freer translation one could take both plant substances as references to “incense” or “incense stuff.” A possible model that does this is:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>You bring your incense all the way from Sheba, but why?</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Why bother with sacrifice-stuff from faraway countries?</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The last half of the verse helps to explain the meaning of the first half, and it would not be out of place to reverse the two halves if that would make the meaning more apparent.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0292_henna"/>Henna <i>Lawsonia inermis</i> grew wild in the oases by the Dead Sea in Old Testament times. It is also known as Egyptian privet and is common in the hot, drier parts of Africa, southern Asia, and northern Australia. Although henna was, and is, primarily used because of its coloring properties derived from the dried leaves, in <s>02200101400006</s> the writer mentions its flowers, which are indeed pretty and fragrant. They are in a “cluster” (<i>’eshkol</i> in Hebrew), which could be taken as a woven object parallel to the little bag of myrrh in verse 13 or as a garland, or simply as a clump of flowers in the cultivated terraces above En Gedi. The reference to henna in <s>02200401300014</s> is strange since it is in the plural form in Hebrew (<i>kefarim</i>), parallel to the yet stranger Hebrew word <i>neradim</i> (from <i>nerd</i>; see <l target="FLORA:4.1.9">4.1.9 Spikenard (nard)</l>). Neither of these plants has significant fruit, so the verse can be taken as a glorious concoction of romantic images of spices and flowers.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The context is clearly metaphorical in both references to henna, so there is the possibility of substituting locally known equivalents. In places where henna is known only as an agent for coloring the hair, skin or fingernails, it may be important to substitute, or to create a note stating that the smell and beauty of the flowers are in focus. In <s>02200401300014</s> most translations ignore the plural, perhaps assuming that it is influenced by the word “fruits” earlier. Alternatively, a transliteration can be used based on a major language (for example, French <i>henné</i>; Spanish <i>alcana</i>, <i>alheña</i>; Portuguese <i>hena</i>, <i>alfenero</i>; Arabic <i>hinna</i>). The recent resurgence in skin decoration (“mehndi”) using henna may make it easier to find a known word. “Camphire” in <a>KJV</a> is perhaps a cultural substitute.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0663_myrrh_branch"/>Myrrh is probably the most precious spice in the Bible. It was worth more than its weight in gold. Our experts agree that the Hebrew word <i>mor</i> refers to the resin of one of the <i>Commiphora</i> genus, either <i>myrrha</i>, <i>abyssinica</i> or <i>schimperi</i>, all of which grew in what is now Yemen, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Madagascar. Other kinds of myrrh may have come from India (<i>Commiphora erythraea</i>, <i>Commiphora opobalsamum</i>). A more difficult question is the meaning of the word <i>deror</i> in <s>00203002300014</s>. In the other places where it occurs it means “freedom” or “liberty.” This is the basis for the word “liquid” in some versions, but there is no certainty that “free” means “liquid.” The fact that myrrh was sometimes mixed with wine may suggest that <i>deror</i> means “liquid” here, but on the other hand, the weight of the myrrh is given in dry measure rather than liquid measure, which argues against it (Durham, page 407).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>lot</i> in <s>00103702500050 00104301100062</s> is translated “myrrh” in <a>RSV</a>, but it should be rendered “ladanum,” according to the latest scholarship (see <l target="FLORA:4.2.5">4.2.5 Rock rose (ladanum)</l>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><a>RSV</a> also renders the Hebrew word <i>nesheq</i> as “myrrh” (similarly <a>REB</a> “perfumes”) in <s>01101002500028 01400902400026</s>, but most other English versions translate it “weapons” or “armor.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0664_myrrh_gum"/>The myrrh plant is a bush or shrub with thick thorny branches that project and bend at odd angles. The leaves come in sets of three. The fruit is oval like a plum. The wood and bark have a pleasant smell. The gum oozes naturally from the branches, though some harvesters incise the branches to increase the flow. The sap or gum is clear or yellowish brown when it comes out, but gets darker as it dries. The taste of the gum is bitter (note the similarity of <i>mor</i> to the Hebrew word <i>mar</i> meaning “bitter”). In markets the gum is often found mixed with that of the kataf bush (<i>bisabol</i>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0665_myrrh_leaf"/>God prescribed myrrh as an ingredient of the holy anointing oil (<s>00203002300014</s>), and it is used as perfume in Esther, Psalms, Proverbs, and eight times in Song of Songs. It was brought as an expensive gift by the Magi to the new King (<s>04000201100060</s>). As Jesus was dying on the cross, sympathetic bystanders may have offered it to him mixed with wine (<s>04101502300008</s>; see the parallel account in <s>04002703401000</s>). Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes to prepare Jesus’ body for burial (<s>04301903900028</s>). In ancient Egypt myrrh was burned on the altars of the sun god, and in Persia it was attached to the crowns of kings when they appeared in public. Romans burned myrrh at funerals and cremations, which helps to explain its inclusion in the list of spices in <s>06601801300016</s>. Today it is used in perfumes, lotions, and even in toothpaste.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Varieties of myrrh grow in the Horn of Africa and Madagascar, so people from those areas should have no difficulty finding words for it. As to whether the myrrh in <s>00203002300014</s> was liquid or solid, there seems to be no consensus, and the translator may be forgiven for simply ignoring the Hebrew word <i>deror</i> (as <a>CEV</a> has done). A variety of models are available for rendering <i>mor deror</i> as follows: “sticks of myrrh” (<a>REB</a>), “free-flowing myrrh” (<a>NAB</a>), “solidified myrrh” (<a>NJPSV</a>), “powdered myrrh” (<a>GW</a>, Durham), “fresh myrrh” (<a>NJB</a>), “liquid myrrh” (<a>GNB</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>NCV</a>), and “pure myrrh” (<a>NLT</a>, <a>LB</a>). Possible transliterations are Hebrew <i>mor</i>, Arabic <i>mar</i>, French <i>mireh</i>, and Spanish/Portuguese <i>mirra</i>. A transliteration from English or French should be pronounceable (for example, <i>mura</i>), not like one early Nigerian translations that carried the unpronounceable “myrrh” over unchanged.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0831_spikenard_plant"/>The name “spikenard” seems to be gaining ground over “nard” in global English. The Hebrew and Greek words for spikenard could have referred to a variety of substances from a variety of plants. Pliny lists twelve kinds. Zohary takes the New Testament spikenard to be the same as the Old Testament one, namely <i>Nardostachys jatamansi</i> from India. Hepper doubts the Indian origin of most biblical spices and suggests that the references in Song of Songs may be to the Camel Grass <i>Cymbopogon schoenanthus</i>, which grows in the deserts of Arabia and North Africa. Assyrians called it <i>lardu</i>. However, if the writing of Song of Songs is late, the Indian origin of spikenard mentioned there is quite possible. The Greek expression <i>nardos pistikos</i> in <s>04101400300038 04301200300014</s> is rendered “pure nard” by <a>RSV</a>, but the meaning of <i>pistikos</i> is debatable. It may in fact come from the Sanskrit <i>picita</i>, the local name of the spikenard plant. In Arabic spikenard is called <i>sunbul Hindi</i> (“Indian spike”).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The spikenard plant is a leafy bush less than a meter (3 feet) high, with fragrant-smelling, short stems and a tuft of three narrow leaflets at the tip of each stem. The pink flowers are umbrella-shaped. The rhizomes (tubers) are pounded to extract pungent, pale orange or yellow oil.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The two references to spikenard in <s>02200401300018 02200401400002</s> are metaphorical, the bride being referred to as a luxurious garden or park filled with all kinds of lovely spice plants and trees. The spikenard there is mentioned first in the plural in Hebrew, paired with a plural form of henna, as though they are plants or trees, or perhaps the fruit of trees. Then its singular form is paired with saffron, followed by calamus and cinnamon. Spikenard was a luxury item in ancient Egypt, the Near East, and Rome. A Chinese medical text written around 1100 <a>A.D.</a> notes the calming effect of spikenard incense. It is still used in incense sticks (<i>senko</i>) in China and as a medicine. It is also used in Japan as an ingredient of the incense used in the Plum Blossom Festival. In <s>04301200300014</s> spikenard is cited as the “costly perfume” used by Mary, the sister of Lazarus, to anoint Jesus.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>For the metaphorical references in Song of Songs a cultural equivalent of spikenard is appropriate. The references in Mark and John are of course non-rhetorical and should be translated with a local name for spikenard where possible or transliterated where translators feel it is important to be concordant throughout. A transliteration such as “naridi” is recommended.</Paragraph>

In <s>00402400600012</s>; <s>01904500900006</s>; and some other places aloe refers to chips of fragrant wood from the agarwood tree found in northern India (see <l target="FLORA:4.1.1">4.1.1</l>). However, the New Testament reference to aloe is to the True Aloe <i>Aloe vera</i>. This aloe originated in southern Africa, Arabia, and Madagascar. The gel-like substance in the leaves of the aloe has been used as medicine for centuries, especially to treat burns and abrasions of the skin. It is also used as a laxative, and in modern times as an ingredient in all kinds of skin creams, soaps, shampoo, and even as a drink (in Asia), or as an additive to tea.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0115_castor_leaf"/>The identity of Jonah’s <i>qiqayon</i> plant has been debated since the days of St. Jerome and St. Augustine. Zohary, Hepper, and Moldenke all advocate the castor oil plant (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) as the <i>qiqayon</i>, followed by <a>NJB</a>, <a>FFB</a>, various commentaries, and some Bible encyclopedias. But <a>KJV</a> “gourd” has a long history, including its use in the Septuagint (<i>kolocuntha</i> in Greek; see <l target="FLORA:5.2.6">5.2.6 Wild gourd (colocynth, egusi, bitter apple)</l>) and in <a>REB</a>, <a>NAB</a>, <a>Mft</a>, and <a>AT</a>. The Vulgate translated <i>qiqayon</i> as <i>hedera</i> (“ivy”; see <l target="FLORA:1.10">1.10 Ivy</l>) and that is used in Knox, but that rendering has not had further botanical support. In 1985 Robinson did an in-depth study of the literature going back as far as St. Jerome and votes hesitantly for the gourd (colocynth). Some scholars even suggest it could be an Assyrian word inserted in the story just to make it sound foreign, or even a made-up word.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>A number of translators have decided to avoid choosing between “gourd” and “castor oil plant” by selecting generic words here, for example, “vine” (<a>CEV</a>, <a>NIV</a>) and “plant” (<a>RSV</a>, <a>GNB</a>). <a>NJPSV</a> has “ricinus,” which uses the Latin for “castor bean.” Since the castor bean is originally an African plant, it will be known by most translators there. Some may prefer to transliterate the term for it from a major language (for example, Arabic <i>karwa</i>; French <i>ricin</i>; Portuguese <i>ricino</i>, <i>bofarera</i>, <i>karapatero</i>; Spanish <i>catapucia</i>, <i>higuera</i>, <i>higuerillo</i>) or use a generic descriptive phrase such as “leafy bush.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0597_liquidambar"/>The Hebrew word <i>tsori</i> (“balm”) may be the basis for the word “storax,” which Zohary takes to be a name for the dried resin of the Liquidambar <i>Liquidambar orientalis</i>, a tree that is also called <i>kataf</i> or <i>nataf</i> in Hebrew. <a>FFB</a> and <i>The Anchor Bible Dictionary</i> (<a>ABD</a>) suggest that <i>tsori</i> is <i>Balanites aegyptiaca</i>, which grows in both Palestine and Egypt, but this position raises a question: Why would the Ishmaelite (or Midianite) traders carry it to Egypt if it is already plentiful there? It is more likely that the word is generic and could cover all kinds of medicinal spices.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>nataf</i> does not occur outside of <s>00203003400018</s> in the Bible. The Septuagint renders it <i>staktē</i>, which <a>RSV</a> transliterates as “stacte.” According to Zohary, <i>nataf</i> is a synonym of <i>tsori</i> (= storax), which is found six times in the Bible. Hepper concedes this as possible but suggests that <i>nataf</i> may also be the opobalsamum (see <l target="FLORA:4.2.4">4.2.4 Opobalsamum (balsam, balm)</l>), which Zohary calls “balm.” The liquidambar (or storax) is a tree that used to grow widely in the Middle East and Turkey. It is quite a different tree from the streamside styrax (see <l target="FLORA:1.22">1.22 Styrax</l>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The genus <i>Liquidambar</i> was widespread many thousands of years ago, according to fossil evidence, but it disappeared from Europe when the glaciers came. The surviving species, apart from <i>orientalis</i> in the Middle East, are <i>formosana</i> in South China and Taiwan and <i>styraciflua</i> in the eastern United States and Central America.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The references to <i>tsori</i> in Genesis and Ezekiel are non-rhetorical, as is <i>nataf</i> in Exodus. If Zohary is correct, and the translator wants to be specific, then a transliteration of “storax” may be used in these passages. Alternatively, in <s>00203003400018</s> translators can use a generic expression such as “resin” (<a>NCV</a>) or “gum resin” (<a>NIV</a>, <a>REB</a>); that is, they can use their local word for the globs of hardened sap that come from trees that produce it.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If a word for “sweet-smelling healing ointment” exists, it can be used for <i>tsori</i> in Genesis. <i>Tsori</i> is the second of three spices the Ishmaelite traders carried in <s>00103702500046</s>, the other two being <i>neko’th</i> (“gum”) and <i>lot</i> (“myrrh”). Translators can cover all three words with a phrase such as “different kinds of sweet-smelling medicine and incense.” Transliteration is also possible, from Hebrew <i>tsori</i> or Arabic <i>nakaa</i> /<i>nakati</i>. “Balm” in English is not a good basis for transliteration.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0053_balsam"/>The Hebrew word <i>bosem</i>, which is often rendered “balm” (derived from “balsam”), can refer to any type of aromatic healing substance, but it also designates the product of a particular tree, the Balsam or Opobalsamum <i>Commiphora gileadensis</i>. Arabs call it <i>balasam</i> or <i>balasham</i>. In the Talmud it is called <i>afarsimon</i>. Excavations near En Gedi have uncovered an ancient processing plant for balsam oil.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Moldenke is of the opinion that in <s>02200500100018</s> <i>bosem</i> (rendered “spice”) refers to gum tragacanth (see <l target="FLORA:4.2.7">4.2.7 Tragacanth (gum tragacanth)</l>). We support Zohary and Hepper who associate <i>bosem</i> with opobalsamum.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The opobalsamum tree likes a desert or semi-desert climate. It grows to 2–3 meters (7–10 feet) tall and has small, wrinkled, three-part leaves, white flowers, and pea-sized red berries that have a fragrant yellow seed inside. The bark of younger branches is gray, turning brown with age. The resin appears by itself in green droplets from the stems and branches, but collectors also make cuts in the branches to speed the process. The droplets turn from green to brown, clump together, and fall to the ground, where they are collected.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>People in the Near East collect the globs of sap that appear on the leaves of ladanum. They use small rakes with soft leather strips instead of metal teeth. On the island of Cyprus local farmers collect the gum by combing the beards of their goats that had foraged on the plants. Today it is used primarily in the manufacture of incense.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The references to ladanum are non-metaphorical, so translators have traditionally used a generic expression for it (for example, <a>Mft</a> with: “fragrant gum”) or a transliteration (for example, <a>AT</a> with “laudanum”). Other possible models are for transliteration are Hebrew <i>lot</i> and Arabic <i>ladan</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00203003401022</s>: Most commentators, perhaps influenced by the Septuagint, take the Hebrew word <i>shecheleth</i> (“onycha”) as referring to “onyx,” a kind of stone, not a plant. Zohary does not discuss it. Given the context (a list of ingredients for incense), both <a>FFB</a> and Hepper feel it is probably a resin-producing plant, possibly of the genus <i>Cistus</i>, like ladanum. Moldenke suggests that onycha may have applied to two substances, one being some kind of resin, and the other a substance coming from the shell of a mollusk living in the Mediterranean Sea. The resin option is supported by the fact that Arabic versions of the Bible have <i>ladana</i>, implying that the substance was ladanum. In view of the uncertainty about the identity of <i>shecheleth</i>, the easy way out for translators is to transliterate from a major language such as English (<i>onika</i>, <i>oniki</i>). For those who want to be more specific, “mollusk scent” (Durham) or “aromatic shell” (<a>REB</a>) could be considered.</Paragraph>

However, according to Moldenke, Arabic <i>kurkum</i> refers to the plant, and the product from it is called <i>saferan</i>, from which we get the English word “saffron” (compare Arabic <i>asfar</i>, meaning “yellow”). Saffron is now widely known as a food additive and dye, but in Bible times it was also considered a perfume and medicine. It comes from the reddish-purple flowers of the crocus, which grew throughout Asia Minor in Bible times. Since then it has been widely cultivated in Europe, England, and America. The English word “crocus” comes from Hebrew <i>karkom</i> via Greek <i>krokos</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Archeological records indicate that saffron was cultivated in the seventh century <a>B.C.</a> in Assyria and later in Crete (Bronze Age). Saffron-based paint has been found in four thousand year old pictures in what is today Iraq. The Sumerians used saffron for medicine and magical potions and traded it with other kingdoms. International trade reached a peak with the Minoans in the second millennium <a>B.C.</a> Use of saffron spread into Asia via the Persians and/or the Mongol invaders, and today Buddhist monks in India wear saffron-colored robes. Merchants in the Middle East sell dried safflower (<i>Carthamus tinctorius</i>) as <i>saferan</i>, but real saffron comes only from crocus flowers. The fake saffron is appropriately called <i>alazor bastardo</i> in Spanish and <i>safran batard</i> in French.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>In Bible times saffron was used as perfume and as medicine, but today it is mostly known as a coloring agent for cloth and food. One reason why it was costly is that it takes about six hundred flowers to produce a few drops of oil.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Since Bible times the saffron crocus has been grown mostly in the Mediterranean basin, but it also thrives in India, Oceania, and North Africa, so in those places local words will likely be found. Elsewhere, transliteration from a major language is recommended (for example Arabic <i>asfar</i>, <i>zafaran</i>, <i>kruku</i>, <i>kurkum</i>; French <i>safran</i>; Portuguese <i>asafrao</i>; Spanish <i>azafran</i>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0878_tragacanth"/><i>Neko’th</i> (“gum”) is the first of three spices mentioned in <s>00103702500042</s> as being carried by the Ishmaelites along with <i>tsori</i> (“balm”) and <i>lot</i> (mistranslated as “myrrh”) to Egypt. In <s>00104301100058</s> Jacob urges his sons to carry some <i>neko’th</i> to Egypt as a gift to the Pharaoh. It was an important ingredient of incense and was probably used for medicine as well. The Hebrew word <i>neko’th</i> refers to tragacanth. Most the eighteen hundred species of tragacanth (commonly called “milk vetches”) of the genus <i>Astragalus</i> produce tragacanth gum, but the ones growing in Judea and Gilead (<i>Astragalus gummifer</i> and <i>Astragalus bethlehemiticus</i>) are outstanding in their production.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The tragacanth shrub grows to about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in height and branches densely right from the base. Some of the plants at high elevations or in poor soil cling to the ground looking like sea anemones or pin cushions, with their sharp spines. The flowers, which grow from the point where the leaf joins the stem, give way to tiny wooly fruits that disperse in the wind.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The gum of the tragacanth shrub is stored in the roots, providing moisture for the plant during the dry season. People who collect the sap expose a root, make a cut in it, and place a cup where it will catch the globs of sap that ooze from the root. They often have many plants that they tap in this way. Tapping typically begins in June. Today tragacanth is still used in incense and medicine, but also in leatherworking, baking, and even in the production of cigars.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Genesis contexts are both non-rhetorical, so the translator may choose a general phrase to cover all of the terms in the list. If not, <i>neko’th</i> may be rendered “rubbing medicine,” or a transliteration from a major language may be used. A transliteration from English is “tiragacanti,” but this is unwieldy. If there is a word for the dried sap (gum) of trees, that could be used by itself or in combination with a transliteration. Arabic <i>nakaa</i> may be useful in some places.</Paragraph>

          <Heading>We begin this section with the usual survey of generic expressions. While some of us think of grass as the green stuff that has to be removed from the farm before planting, or the stuff surrounding our house that needs to be cut short regularly, botanists look at a mammoth family of plants (<i>Poaceae</i>) containing over nine thousand species grouped into six hundred genera. The family includes the major food grains (cereals) grown around the world: rice, maize, sorghum, wheat, barley, quinoa, rye, and others. It includes bamboo, which is a major construction material, as well as reeds and canes used for baskets, beds, musical instruments, paper, and chairs. Even sugarcane is a type of grass. All have hollow stems, joints where leaves protrude, sheaths protecting the base of the leaf, a seed head of some type with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers lacking petals, and narrow sword-shaped leaves that grow at the base, not at the tip.</Heading>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><s>00100101101000 00100101201000</s> gives us a good introduction to the problem of generic and specific vocabulary in Hebrew. God’s speech in verse 11 begins literally “Let the earth sprout [<i>tadshe’</i> ] sprouts [<i>deshe’</i> ], plants [<i>‘esev</i> ] bearing seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit … .” Scholars continue to debate about the Hebrew word <i>deshe’</i>. Is it a generic word introducing the two categories that follow, or is it the first of three categories: grass, seed plants, and fruit trees? (See the Discussion and Translation under <l target="FLORA:5.1.2">5.1.2 Grass</l> for more detail.).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Another generic Hebrew expression is found in <s>00100103000052</s>, where God gives <i>yereq ‘esev</i> (“green plants”) to the animals for food. Interestingly, in <s>00100900300022</s> the same <i>yereq ‘esev</i> is to serve as food for Noah in the ark along with the meat of animals.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The generic Hebrew word <i>siach</i> also needs to be mentioned. This word usually means “complaint,” “musing,” “meditation,” or “chatter.” In a few places it refers to “bushes” or “shrubs.” It occurs with the latter meaning in <s>00100200500006 00102101500032 01803000400010 01803000700004</s>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0118_cattails"/>The Hebrew word <i>suf</i> probably designates more than one species of the cattail, also called “reed-mace” and “bulrush.” There are two in Israel: <i>Typha domingensis</i> and <i>Typha latifolia</i> (<i>Typha australis</i> according to Zohary). Both species like to stand in the slow-moving water on the edge of rivers and streams. The reference to <i>suf</i> (“weeds”) in <s>03200200600014</s> (5) supports Zohary’s conjecture that <i>suf</i> may be a collective name for many water plants. <i>Suf</i> is paired with <i>qaneh</i> (“reeds”) in <s>02301900600022</s>, so it is almost certainly the cattail since both are found in marshes and slow streams.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Some writers have suggested that the “reed” placed in the hand of Jesus at his mock trial was a cattail stalk (<s>04002702900024</s>). Others have countered that a cattail flower stalk would not have been ripe that early in the year. But it could also have been a stalk from the previous season. The debate continues.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The cattail reaches 3 meters (10 feet) in height and is notable for its soft, fuzzy brown seed head that eventually disintegrates into fluffy material that blows away in the wind and floats on the water. The plant also spreads through its thick roots, which creep along the bottom of shallow lakes and streams. Its leaves are long, erect, and sharply pointed.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
              <Paragraph>Most kinds of cattail are found in Europe and North America, where the leaves are used for mats and chair seats. Some <i>Typha</i> species in India (<i>Typha elephantina</i>) are used for making paper and ornaments. Translators who live near rivers may have other reed-like plants that can be used, keeping in mind that there are four reed-like plants mentioned in the Bible (see also <l target="FLORA:5.1.3">5.1.3 Papyrus</l>, <l target="FLORA:5.1.4">5.1.4 Reed (common reed, giant reed)</l>, and <l target="FLORA:5.1.5">5.1.5 Rush (bulrush, sedge)</l>. In <s>00200200300060 00200200500050</s> a number of English versions use the generic word “reeds” (<a>RSV</a>, <a>NRSV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>LB</a>, <a>REB</a>, <a>NJB</a>, <a>NJPSV</a>). <a>GW</a> has “papyrus plants,” but the experts prefer to see papyrus associated with the Hebrew word <i>gome’</i>. In communities that are unfamiliar with waterside vegetation, generic expressions such as “tall grass” (<a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>) or “tall stalks of grass” (<a>NCV</a>) may be effective. The basic options for rendering <i>suf</i> in Exodus and Isaiah are:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. a local grass that grows in streams and rivers;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. a generic word such as “grass”;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. a descriptive phrase such as “tall grass.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>suf</i> has a different sense in <s>03200200600014</s> (5). In this passage the plants are living in the water without roots or are perhaps rooted in the bottom of a shallow sea. So translations typically use “seaweed” (<a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, <a>GW</a>, <a>REB</a>), a plant with long, grass-like leaves that is often not attached to the soil under the sea.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If specific transliterations of <i>suf</i> are needed, adaptations of the following major language words could be considered: Arabic <i>bardi</i>, <i>but</i>, <i>dadi</i>, <i>tifa</i>; French <i>jonc</i>, <i>marset</i>; Portuguese <i>murao</i>, <i>tabua</i>; and Spanish <i>aseña</i>, <i>enea</i>, <i>espadaina</i>, <i>españada</i>, <i>junco</i>, <i>macio</i>, <i>totora</i>, <i>tule espidilla</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew expression <i>yam suf</i> (literally “sea of reeds”) has been translated somewhat inaccurately by the Septuagint translators and many others as “Red Sea.” <i>A Handbook on Exodus</i> recommends following the Hebrew, which is literally “Sea of Reeds,” or the modern equivalent “Gulf of Suez” as in <a>GNB</a>, unless there is a strong tradition in the receptor culture for “Red Sea.” If “Red Sea” is used, then a footnote should be added, giving “Sea of Reeds” as the literal meaning of the Hebrew text.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0049_grass"/>There are over 450 species of grass in the Holy Land, and it is unlikely that the Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Latin words above refer to particular species. They are probably generic words that have at one time or other, or in one place or another, referred to various kinds of grass.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>According to Zohary, in <s>00104100200036 00104101800036</s> the Hebrew word <i>’achu</i> (“reed grass”) refers not to a kind of grass but to “damp swampy land used for grazing” (page 127; see <a>KJV</a> “meadow”). However, <s>01800801100016</s> seems to speak specifically of some kind of plant (parallel to papyrus), stating that <i>’achu</i> cannot grow where there is no water.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>chashash</i> in <s>02300502400016</s> is used for dry grass, parallel to stubble, referring to the wicked who will be burned up. In <s>02303301100004</s> the futile plans of the wicked are likened to <i>chashash</i>, again parallel to stubble.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The eight occurrences of the Hebrew word <i>yereq</i> (“green”) in the Old Testament refer to vegetation. Most of them occur in a phrase such as <i>yereq ‘esev</i> (rendered “green plant” in <s>00100103000052 00100900300022</s>) or <i>yereq deshe’</i> (rendered “tender grass” or “green herb” in <s>01201902600026 01903700200020 02303702700026</s>). However, in three passages <i>yereq</i> stands alone (rendered “grass,” “verdue,” or “green thing” in <s>00201001500066 00402200400038 02301500600020</s>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>deshe’</i> is sometimes translated “grass.” It usually occurs in rhetorical contexts, where it is often parallel to <i>chatsir</i>, <i>yereq</i>, or <i>‘esev</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>‘esev</i> occurs thirty-three times in the Bible and is translated by <a>RSV</a> as “plant” in twelve of them, as “grass” in twelve, as “herb” or “herbage” in five, and as “vegetation” in four. Since there may be languages that have no generic word like “plant,” they may be able to use their word for “grass” or “growing things” in many of these passages when it is appropriate.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There are a number of words for “pasture,” the grassy fields in which sheep, goats, and cows like to graze. Hebrew has not less than five words: apart from <i>mir‘eh</i>, listed above, there are also <i>migrash</i> (114 times, mostly in Joshua and 1 Chronicles), <i>dover</i> (<s>02300501700010</s>; <s>03300201200038</s>), <i>kar</i> (<s>01903702000018</s>; <s>01906501400004</s>; <s>02303002300054</s>), and <i>nawah</i> (11 times).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Apart from all of the above, there is also the Hebrew word <i>teven</i>, which is translated “straw”—dried grass used for bricks and as bedding for animals. For example, this word occurs in <s>00102402500010 00102403200026</s>, but translators need to be aware that “straw” for the camels was not for the camels to eat but rather was put on the ground to absorb the urine of the animals.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There are two Hebrew words that are usually translated “fodder” (that is, animal food) or “provender”: <i>belil</i> (<s>01800600500020</s>; <s>01802400600008</s>; <s>02303002400020</s>) and <i>mispo’</i> (<s>00102402500014</s>, <s>00102403200030</s>; <s>00104202700018</s>; <s>00104302400036</s>; <s>00701901900010</s>). These words probably refer to some type of grass.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the New Testament the Greek word <i>chortos</i> occurs fifteen times and is usually translated by <a>RSV</a> as “grass.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek word <i>lachanon</i> occurs four times in the New Testament. It is a generic term for garden plants that can be translated according to its context. In <s>04001303200026 04100403200020</s> the mustard seed grows to become bigger than all the <i>lachanon</i> (“shrubs”) of the garden. The Pharisees tithe mint, rue, and every <i>lachanon</i> (“herb”) in <s>04201104200030</s>. The weaker brother of <s>04501400200018</s> eats only <i>lachanon</i> (“vegetables”).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek word <i>botanē</i> is another generic term. It is translated “vegetation” in <s>05800600700026</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the Deuterocanon the Greek word <i>chloē</i> means “young green growth” (<s>07104002200018 07104302100016</s>). This same word occurs in the Septuagint to translate the Hebrew word <i>deshe’</i> (<s>01002300400028</s>; <s>01201902600026</s>; <s>01803802700020</s>; <s>01902300200006</s>; <s>01903700200020</s>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Grass is so common to most translators that no description is needed. However, for translators who live above the Arctic Circle or in inhospitable deserts, the grasses of the lands of the Bible may cause problems. A common problem is having too many specific words and no generic one. I recall a translation team in Niger (Tamasheq) that really struggled with “sat down on the green grass” in <s>04100603900022</s>, because the only grass they knew (appearing in the short rainy season), was not something anyone would want to sit on. Grass can be described as being less than a meter (3 feet) high, with narrow, green, upright leaves, usually growing in bunches or clumps.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In the case of some African languages, a word translated “grass” actually refers to “unexploited vegetation” in contrast to plants used for food, medicine, and utensils. It is possible that such a distinction was present in Hebrew as well, but at this point we don’t know about it. Before translating, it will be important to investigate how the local people categorize the plant world. Once the local taxonomy is known, the translators can decide how much or how little of it they want to use, depending on their general principles of accommodation in the translation as a whole.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Where possible, the Hebrew word <i>deshe’</i> should carry the meaning of new growth or fresh sprouts of a plant. Since it usually occurs in rhetorical contexts and is often parallel with other references to grass, the translator needs to think of pairs or triplets of words that refer to grass and grass-like plants.</Paragraph>
              <Paragraph><s>00100101100008</s> a: “Let the earth put forth vegetation [<i>deshe’</i> ].” On the basis of this verse’s parallelism with verse 20, I support the majority view here that there are two categories with a generic introducer (see the <l target="FLORA:5.1">introductory comments</l> on this section). The translator needs the most general word for plants here to render <i>deshe’</i>.* If there is no generic word available, a phrase such as “things with leaves” or “sprouting things” is appropriate. As a last resort, one could simply omit the generic term and translate the specifics.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00100101100008</s> b: “Plants yielding seed.” It is difficult to know if the Hebrew phrase here (<i>‘esev mazri‘a zera‘</i>) is talking about plants whose “fruit” is a seed, like rice, or any kind of plants that have seeds, including tomatoes, peppers, grapes, eggplants, and so forth. The English versions stay ambiguous; for example, <a>GNB</a> “those that bear grain,” <a>CEV</a> “grain,” <a>NCV</a> “some to make grain for seeds,” <a>NIV</a> “seed-bearing plants” (also <a>NJB</a>, <a>NJPSV</a>; similarly <a>NLT</a>, <a>GW</a>), and <a>REB</a> “plants that bear seed.” “Grain” (equivalent to “corn” in British English) may be too narrow. In either case, this category is set off against what follows, namely, fruit-bearing plants like apples and mangoes.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00100101100008</s> c: “Fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed.” The issue here is whether the Hebrew phrase <i>’asher zar‘o vo</i> (“in which is their seed”) is a redundant expression like “of the air” after birds, or whether the phrase actually adds information. <a>GNB</a> and <a>CEV</a> take it as redundant (<a>GNB</a> “those that bear fruit,” <a>CEV</a> “fruit trees”). Others seem to feel it necessary to retain this phrase (for example, <a>NCV</a> “others to make fruits with seeds in them,” and <a>NJB</a> “fruit trees … bearing fruit with their seed inside” [similarly <a>NJPSV</a> ]).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00100101100008</s> d: “Each according to its kind.” <a>GW</a> says “each according to its own type.” There seem to be three interpretations of the Hebrew phrase here in the English versions:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. Some take it as emphasizing the multiplicity of plant types; for example, <a>GNB</a> and <a>CEV</a> say “all kinds of plants” (similarly <a>NAB</a>, <a>NJPSV</a>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. Some seem to focus on the categorization of plants; for example, <a>NIV</a> says “according to their various kinds,” and <a>NJB</a> has “each corresponding to its own species.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. Some focus on the reproductivity of plants; for example, <a>NCV</a> says “Every seed will produce more of its own kind of plant” and <a>NLT</a> has “The seeds will then produce the kinds of plants and trees from which they came.” Compare <a>REB</a>, which reads “each with its own kind of seed.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A major theme of the writer in <s>00100101100014</s> seems to be the orderliness—the categories and subcategories—of creation. This supports <a>NIV</a> and <a>NJB</a>. But the repeated use of “seed” indicates that the writer is also interested in the regularity of genetic laws. Echoing this theme, Deuteronomy includes laws strictly forbidding the mixture of different kinds (“seeds” in some languages!) of plants in farms and fibers in clothes. Christ added his own version to this Hebrew concern when he said, “Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles?” (<s>04000701601000</s>). Possible models for <s>00100101100000</s> are:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. Let the earth be covered with plants. Let there be plants with seeds [or, a local subcategory] and trees with fruit [or, a local subcategory]. Let each one have a different kind of seed.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. Let different kinds of plants sprout from the ground and cover the whole earth. Let there be grass, shrubs, and trees [or, plants with seeds and trees with fruit; or, grain, vegetables, and fruit trees]. Let each kind produce its own.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Translators, after carefully studying the categorization system of their own language, should consider which of the two basic structures of this verse matches their own best. It is quite possible that the three-way division taken by <a>NLT</a> and some commentaries would fit the local system better. If so, there is no harm in following it.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Once translators have investigated their local taxonomy, they must decide whether to use it or to try to express the Hebrew categorization. In the absence of middle level generic terms, translators could say “plants like rice” and “plants like mangos,” though this carries the hazard of implying that the original audience had rice or mangos.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew categorization is more typological than strictly logical or scientific, so it leaves us with overlap and ambiguity. Probably the most important thing that the writer intends to show is the orderliness of God’s creation.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01201902600026</s>: The last two lines of this verse read “like grass [<i>chatsir</i> ] on the housetops; blighted before it is grown” (also <s>02303702700026</s>; similarly <s>01912900600006</s>). These lines gives us a picture of a house with a flat roof where dust could settle, forming a fertile but shallow environment for the germination of grass seeds. However, the grass was doomed to wither and die quickly because of the lack of moisture and soil. There is a textual problem with the last line. <a>HOTTP</a> backs the <a>MT</a>, which reads “blighted/scorced before it rises” (<i>shedefah lifne qamah</i>). It gives a “C” rating to the <a>MT</a> over against the conjecture, which reads “blighted/scorched before the east wind” (<i>shedefah lifne qadim</i>). The conjection is followed by <a>GNB</a> and <a>REB</a>. <a>HOTTP</a> concludes that the copyist(s), lacking sufficient knowledge of Hebrew, didn’t understand this line and guessed that it might have meant “scorched by the east wind,” which is also very logical. The consensus appears to follow the <a>MT</a> (so <a>RSV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>LB</a>, <a>GW</a>). <a>NJPSV</a> also follows the <a>MT</a> by saying “blasted before the standing grain,” which makes no sense at all in the context.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0693_papyrus"/>Although there has been considerable debate among botanists as to the identity of the various types of reed in the Bible, there is general agreement that the Hebrew word <i>gome’</i> refers to the Papyrus <i>Cyperus papyrus</i>, based on etymological and practical grounds. As for the Hebrew word <i>’eveh</i>, the phrase “skiffs of <i>’eveh</i> in <s>01800902600008</s> suggests that it refers to papyrus, since boats in Egypt were made of papyrus, apart from those made from wood. However, versions are divided between “papyrus” (<a>NIV</a>) and “reed” (<a>RSV</a>, <a>REB</a>) in this passage.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Papyrus was the most versatile grass in the Ancient Near East. In Egypt it was used to make boxes, mats, ropes, and especially paper. Perhaps its use in boats came to the mind of Jochebed when she wanted to save her infant son Moses from the wrath of the Pharoah (<s>00200200300020</s>). Job’s companion Bildad uses papyrus as an example of a plant that needs water, and further as a slam at Job suggesting he must have sinned <s>01800801100006</s>). <s>02301800200020</s> refers to “ambassadors by the Nile, in vessels of papyrus” as emblems of the great political power of Egypt. Poor people also used papyrus for barrels, huts, sandals, and clothing. Perhaps surprisingly, papyrus was not usually used for baskets. The baskets of the Egyptians, like those in sub-Saharan Africa today, were made of coiled construction using a core of date palm leaflets, fibers, or the split midrib, with a fiber wrapped around the core, like a guitar string.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>There are over six hundred kinds of <i>Cyperus</i> growing in tropical and warm climates throughout the world, but many do not resemble the papyrus. For example, the tigernut sedge, found in West Asia and Africa and producing a tasty tuber (also called <i>chufa</i> or <i>Zulu nut</i>), belongs to the <i>Cyperus</i> genus. So also do the coco grass and several other types used for mats throughout Asia. The papyrus proper is now rare in Egypt but rampant in northern Uganda, where it is called <i>sudd</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Most of the contexts where <i>gome’</i> is found are rhetorical (<s>00200200300020</s> being the exception), opening the way for translators to substitute local equivalents. However, if the original plant name is replaced, it is usually good to document the original in a footnote, especially where the word identifies a particular area, as in <s>02301800101020</s>, where papyrus vessels are identified with “Ethiopia.” In <s>00200200300020</s> the mother of Moses did not use “bulrushes” (<a>RSV</a>, <a>KJV</a>) but papyrus, nor did she make a “basket” (<a>RSV</a>) but a “box” (<i>tevah</i> in Hebrew). If there is a word for “box,” it should be used. Otherwise, the general word for “basket” can be used, and a type of strong grass used for baskets should be used for the material. The following options are available for <i>gome’</i>:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. use a local strong grass;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. use a descriptive phrase such as “strong grass”;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. use a generic word for “grass”;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>4. leave the plant implicit as part of the verb “weave” or the noun “box/basket” in <s>00200200300020</s>;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>5. use “rush” (<a>REB</a>), “papyrus reeds” (<a>LB</a>), or “reeds” (<a>GNB</a>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>If transliterations are needed for papyrus, some possibilities are French <i>jonc</i> and Portuguese/Spanish <i>papiro</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02303500700040</s>: The last two lines of this verse read “the haunt of jackals shall become a swamp, the grass shall become reeds and rushes [<i>gome’</i> ].” Here translators must have a set of words for grass since these two parallel lines need to show a progression: what was once desert (a haunt of jackals) will become a swamp; and what was once ordinary grass will become grass growing in water.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0752_reed"/>There are two general types of reed in Israel, the Common Reed <i>Phragmites australis</i> and the Giant Reed <i>Arundo donax</i>, and it is impossible to say which one is intended in a given biblical context.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The English word “cane” comes from the Hebrew word <i>qaneh.</i><i>Qaneh</i> is the most general Hebrew word of the many referring to reeds and rushes. Like the English word “reed,” it may refer to a specific type of reed or be a general name for several kinds of water plant. This word is also used to refer to the stalk of grain in Pharaoh’s dream (<s>00104100500024</s>, <s>00104102200022</s>), to the shaft and branches of the golden lampstand in the Tabernacle (<s>00202503100024 00202503200032 00202503300036</s>, <s>00202503500012 00202503600006</s>; <s>00203701700030 00203701800016 00203701900034</s>, <s>00203702100026 00203702200006</s>), to the beam of a scale (<s>02304600600020</s>), to the upper arm of a person (<s>01803102200016</s>), to a measuring stick (<s>02604000300036</s>, <s>02604000500032 02604000600058 02604000700016 02604000800020</s>; <s>02604000500064</s>; <s>02604201600012 02604201700018 02604201800016 02604201900018</s>), and to aromatic cane (<s>00203002300024</s>; <s>02200401400008</s>; <s>02304302400014</s>; <s>02400602000018</s>; <s>02602701900026</s>; see <l target="FLORA:4.1.2">4.1.2</l>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The common reed of the Mediterranean area has relatives in Europe, India, Japan, and North America. It is thought to be the only species of the genus <i>Phragmites</i> (although some botanists divide it into three species). It is very important for conservationists, because it provides habitat for many kinds of animals and birds. In North America the weaker native type is being overtaken by more robust types from Europe, which are now threatening other kinds of marsh plants. In Japan people eat the young shoots of reeds. Native Americans used to eat the seeds.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Arundo</i> species are found throughout the Mediterranean area and also in Taiwan and are still used for making the reeds for clarinets, pipes for pipe organs (“Spanish cane”), fishing rods, and walking sticks.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the form of cellulose, reeds are also used in the rayon industry.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Translators living near lakes and rivers will be able to find an equivalent, if not a relative, of the reed. Others can be generic and use “grass” or a phrase such as “tall grass growing in the water.”</Paragraph>

Pieces of cotton cloth that old have been found there. However, it was not grown in the land of Israel until a few centuries before Christ.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The story of Esther takes place in Babylon in the time of Ahasuerus (= Xerxes) 485–465 <a>B.C.</a> By that time both cotton and flax products were probably traded back and forth throughout the Babylonian Empire, and the cultivation of both was probably expanding, although the area of India, Pakistan, and Babylonia would have been the area of largest production. Herodotus, in the fifth century <a>B.C.</a>, mentions “trees that bear wool” from India.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The writer of Esther describes fabric made from <i>karpas</i>, a Hebrew word that comes from Sanskrit, a language spoken long ago in India, where cotton was domesticated. That may be evidence that <i>karpas</i> probably refers to cotton alone, particularly since the Hebrew word <i>buts</i> is probably used for “linen” in the same verse.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Some botanists have stated that some of the “linen” mentioned in the Scriptures may actually be cotton, especially in the later books of the Old Testament, written when cotton would have been well known. Also, the forty-nine references to the Hebrew word <i>tekeleth</i>, usually translated “blue” or “purple” and often in conjunction with <i>argamon</i>, may have been cotton yarn, though some scholars hold that this material must have been wool.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0156_cotton"/><s>02301900900016</s>, an oracle about Egypt, refers to the “weavers of white cotton [<i>choray</i> ],” parallel to “workers in combed flax.” This supports the contention that cotton was well established in Egypt in Old Testament times, at least by the time of the Israelite monarchy.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0230_flax"/></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0235_flax_stalk"/>Flax <i>Linum usitatissimum</i>, from which linen cloth is made, was cultivated in the Middle East, including Canaan, at least as early as 5000 <a>B.C.</a> It may even have originated in the Holy Land (Zohary, page 78). A document from Gezer (in Israel) from around King Saul’s time (1000 <a>B.C.</a>) refers to the cultivation of flax and states that flax and wool were the main materials for making cloth. According to <s>00600200600018</s>, the Israelite spies were hidden under flax stalks by Rahab. Flax was grown extensively in Egypt and made into cloth and mats.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>Pesheth</i> and <i>pishtah</i> are probably the original Hebrew words for flax, if indeed the plant was domesticated in the Holy Land, as Zohary proposes. They may be related to the word <i>pashat</i>, meaning “to strip off” or “to flay,” or to the word <i>pasas</i>, meaning “to disintegrate.” <i>Pesheth</i> and <i>pishtah</i> are used twenty times in the Old Testament, twice referring clearly to the plant itself (<s>00200903100006 00600200600018</s>). Other references are to the processed flax (<s>00701501400048 02003101300008 02301900900008 02800200700034 02800201100032</s> [5, 9]). A few cases refer to finished products, namely wicks (<s>02304200300012 02304301700032</s>), cords (<s>02604000300028</s>), and items of clothing (<s>02401300100020 02604401700024 02604401800004 02604401800004</s>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0234_flax_flower"/>It is likely that the Hebrews acquired the word <i>shesh</i> from the Egyptians during their sojourn in Egypt, since flax was cultivated there also. The Egyptian word for flax was <i>shent</i> (via <i>shen-suten</i>). <i>Shesh</i> is used thirty-eight times in the Old Testament: for the material that Pharaoh put on Joseph, for the Tabernacle curtains and hangings in Exodus, for the ephod, and for the priests’ tunics. The wise woman of <s>02003102200008</s> wears it. In <s>02601601000022 02601601300016 02601601300016</s> it is paired with silk, and in <s>02602700700002</s> “<i>shesh</i> from Egypt” is spoken of as material for the sails of ships.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Several references to linen use the Hebrew word <i>bad</i>. In <s>00202804200010</s> the priests’ underwear are made from <i>bad</i>, and it is used thereafter in Leviticus to describe various items of clothing—coat, breeches, girdle, and turban. It turns up again in Samuel’s and King David’s “ephods” and then again in Ezekiel and Daniel, where we see visions of “a man clothed in <i>bad</i>.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Linen is referred by the Hebrew word <i>buts</i> in 1–2 Chronicles, Esther, and Ezekiel, where the robes of the Temple choir, kings, and rich men are described. Moldenke holds that this word is Assyrian and refers to linen coming from the East. But it could also be a loanword from Egyptian (compare Egyptian <i>nbos</i> “to clothe”); note also the Hebrew verb <i>bots</i> /<i>bits</i>, meaning “whiten” or “bleach” (<i>Unger’s Bible Dictionary</i>). The Septuagint often uses the Greek word <i>bussos</i> or <i>bussinos</i> in these passages.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Old Testament has four references to the Hebrew word <i>sadin</i> (“linen garment”): <s>00701401200048</s> (Samson promises them to his opponents), <s>02003102400002</s> (the wise woman makes them), and <s>02300302300012</s> (the rich women of Jerusalem wear them). The Septuagint uses the Greek word <i>bussos</i> or <i>sindōn</i> in these passages.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>’etun</i> occurs only in <s>02000701600010</s>, where it refers to a linen bedspread from Egypt (compare the Greek word <i>othonion</i> for burial cloths, and the Greek word <i>othonē</i> in <s>04401001100022</s> for the sheet in Peter’s vision). Here the Septuagint uses the Greek word <i>amphitapos</i>, which normally referred to a double-sided rug.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In the New Testament there are three primary Greek words for linen: <i>linon</i> /<i>linous</i>, <i>sindōn</i>, and <i>othonē</i> /<i>othonion</i>. <i>Linon</i> is used to refer to garments of the angels in <s>06601500600030</s> as well as to the “smoldering wick” in <s>04001202000012</s> (quoting <s>02304200300012</s> and using the same Greek word as in the Septuagint of <s>02304200300012</s>). The synoptic Gospel writers refer to the linen cloth that Joseph and Nicodemus used to wrap Jesus’ body as a <i>sindōn</i>. Mark uses the same word to refer to the cloth that was worn by the unidentified young man at the time of Jesus’ arrest (<s>04101405100014 04101405200010</s>). John uses a different Greek word for Jesus’ burial cloths: <i>othonion</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The rich man referred to in the Lazarus story (<s>04201601900020</s>) is clothed in “fine linen” (<i>bussos</i>). The Greek word <i>bussos</i> is the root word for <i>bussinos</i>, which refers to tunics, robes and turbans made from linen fabric (<s>06601801200022</s>; <s>06601801600020</s>; <s>06601900800012 06601900800012</s>; <s>06601901400028</s>; <s>08100300600034</s>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0232_flax_cutting"/>It is often difficult to tell whether the Hebrew and Greek words for linen refer to a material or to an item of clothing such as a shirt, robe, tunic, or coat.

            <Paragraph>Flax is a little taller than a sesame plant, about a meter (3 feet) tall. Its leaves are narrow and the flowers are bright blue with five petals. The seed capsule contains oil that is used for cooking and also for thinning paint. After flax ripens, the plants are uprooted and the stalks are left to dry for a while. The stalks are then soaked, dried, and beaten to separate the fibers, which are then combed and woven into cloth.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Linen cloth was relatively costly in Israel, and being light and easy to dye it was highly valued. Their priests wore linen garments to combat sweating (see <s>02604401800004 02604401800016</s>). They had to remove these holy garments when they left the Temple, “lest they communicate holiness to the people” (<s>02604401901000</s>). The high esteem given to linen by the Jews is shown also by the fact that they used it for burying the dead, and we are told that the Dead Sea Scrolls were wrapped in linen cloths. However, the flax plant was special in other ways. The crushed stalks of flax plants were also used for making rope and lamp wicks. The seed was used for oil.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Linen cloth (or other cloth with a similar name) is surprisingly widespread. Cloth merchants in the translators’ area may know it under a trade language name, and if so, that can be used. In Hausa of northern Nigeria it is called <i>lilin</i>. In some places it is used only for burying people. In that case, if it is used in translation at all, the difference in culture should be explained in a footnote. Since linen is bleached white, a generic phrase such as “beautiful white cloth” can be considered in many places. English common language versions use phrases such as “beautiful clothing” (<a>NLT</a>) or “fine clothes” (<a>CEV</a>) when garments are involved. In the three metaphorical passages mentioned above (<s>00701501400048 02304200300012 02304301700032</s>), an appropriate cultural image may be substituted, or an adverb expressing weakness or fragility. Models for transliteration in the non-rhetorical passages are the Latin <i>linum</i>; Arabic <i>fitas</i>, <i>kattan</i>; Spanish <i>lino</i>; Portuguese <i>linho</i>; French <i>lin</i>; Tamil <i>alvira</i>; and Chinese <i>ya ma</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>00200903100006 00200903100028</s>, where the reference is to the flax plant and is not rhetorical, the translator can transliterate from a major language such as English (<i>filaks</i> /<i>filas</i>) or from Hebrew (<i>pishita</i> /<i>fisita</i>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0082_bottlegourd"/>The Bottle Gourd or Calabash <i>Lagenaria siceraria</i> was one of the first plants to be domesticated by human beings. It has been used for food, for medicine, and for various utensils and musical instruments. It is indigenous to Africa but was probably introduced into Asia and the Americas about ten thousand years ago, with or without the help of humans. The name of the genus comes from the Latin word <i>lagoena</i>, meaning “flask” (but almost certainly the first Roman flasks were dried gourds). The species name is derived from the Latin word for “dry,” suggesting that the fruit is usable in its dried form. Although the people of the Bible lands undoubtedly used the split bottle gourds in their homes as bowls or “dippers,” as we find in Africa and Asia, the only references we have are to the image of the gourd in the artwork carved into the cedar of King Solomon’s palace (<s>01100601800016</s>) and in the decorating of the giant bronze basin that stood in front of the Temple (<s>01100702400004 01100702400044</s>). According to Zohary, the bottle gourd is also found in the place name “Dilean” (<s>00601503800004</s>), which comes from the Hebrew word <i>dela‘ath</i>, a postbiblical name for the bottle gourd.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The bottle gourd is a climbing vine like a cucumber or pumpkin. Its stem is square, ribbed, and hairy, and can grow up to 5 meters (17 feet) long. The leaves are heart-shaped, the size of a human hand, and slightly lobed. The flowers are yellow with five petals, giving way to fruits that may be of many different shapes depending on the variety. Most gourds are globular at one end, with a protrusion that may be elongated, making them very useful, when cut in half, as big spoons in the kitchen.</Paragraph>

They have also been used for musical instruments. The pulp of most kinds is very bitter and is poisonous in some cases. Some kinds are used in medicine in some countries, for purges, expelling worms, and for chest pains and headache. In southern Africa the leaves are eaten as a vegetable, as are the young, unripe fruits.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0282_hammada"/>The Jews of Jeremiah’s time did not have soap as we know it, since soap was invented many centuries later. However, they did prepare something like it by mixing the ashes of certain plants with olive oil. One of the plants was Hammada <i>Hammada salicornica</i>, commonly found in the desert and called <i>rimth</i> in Arabic. Hepper says any kind of household ashes would have sufficed, but bushes of the goosefoot family (<i>Salsola</i> and <i>Salicornia</i> species, saltworts, and glassworts) would have been especially effective. This is supported by Moldenke, who adds that Arabs call saltwort <i>kali</i> or <i>elkali</i>, which is where we get our chemical term alkali.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>There are two types of <i>Salicornia</i>. The white hammada is a leafless shrub that often grows near acacia trees. It is less than a meter (3 feet) in height and has a jointed green stem. Its tiny flowers appear around December and form small fruits with one seed having a kind of wing that catches the wind and scatters the seed. The black hammada is similar, but darker, and favors a lighter type of soil. Its distribution includes North Africa.</Paragraph>

This refers to the process by which natural oil was washed from woolen cloth before it could be dyed. The fuller took ashes from certain plants and mixed them with olive oil, forming what we would call lye or soda. He would then wash the clothes and dry them in the sun in the fuller’s field (see <s>01201801701000</s>). The lye used was much stronger than our soap—more like the bleach of today—and it is this “fuller’s soap” that is used in Malachi to represent the powerful cleansing God performs on his people.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>It may be useful for translators to investigate local soap making methods to find out what they use for ingredients. If the parallelism of the Hebrew is to be kept in <s>02400202200020</s>, the translator needs two words that refer to making something clean. If there is no equivalent for “lye” (or “soda”), translators could consider poetical cultural equivalents for body-scrubbing things like the loofa gourd or the pumice stone in West Africa. If transliteration is needed, some possibilities for <i>Salsola kali</i> (prickly saltwort) are (apart from the Hebrew <i>borith</i>) Arabic <i>hurd</i>, <i>shawk ahhmar</i>; French <i>soude conchee</i>, <i>sonde kali</i>; Portuguese <i>barilla espinhosa</i>, <i>soda</i>, <i>trago-espinhoso</i>; and Spanish <i>abrojos</i>, <i>barella</i>, <i>salsora</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0616_mandrake"/>Commentators do not agree on the identity of the Hebrew word <i>duda’im</i>. While many assert that the word must refer to Mandragora or Mandrake <i>Mandragora autumnalis</i>, Zohary says it cannot be so since mandragora has never grown in Mesopotamia, where the story of <s>00103001400020 00103001500028 00103001600046</s> takes place. In <s>02200701400004</s> <i>duda’im</i> refers to some sort of “choice fruit” associated with apples, and cultivated on river banks (not dug up in the fields, as was the case with <i>duda’im</i> in Genesis). Whatever the original plant was (in Mesopotamia), when the story was told in Israel they used a word that was known to the hearers, namely <i>duda’im</i>. In Genesis the context implies, though not directly, that <i>duda’im</i> has something to do with fertility. And the most popular conception-inducing plant in Bible times, according to scholars, was the mandragora (mandrake). The translators of the Septuagint and the Targum, with their own ideas about love and fertility, took <i>duda’im</i> in its Holy Land setting rather than trying to establish the identity of the plant in the Mesopotamian context. The English versions have copied the Septuagint, using “mandrake.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0617_mandrake_root"/>The mandrake is a stemless herb related to the potato and tomato but grows lower to the ground. Its leaves are dark green, reaching 30 centimeters (1 foot) long and 10 centimeters (4 inches) wide, spreading out rose-like from the center. Purple or blue flowers appear on stalks out of the center and develop into yellow fruits that, when ripe, look like eggs in a bird’s nest. They have a distinct smell that some find sweet and others unpleasant. The mandrake’s large root is often forked, giving the appearance of a human body, which is perhaps the basis for its widespread reputation as a love potion throughout the Middle East and Europe, and for its name, the “love apple.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The supposed magical properties of mandrakes are many and bizarre. It is said to scream when pulled out of the earth. The leaves are said to shine in the dark. In the Middle Ages Germans dressed them up and made sacrifices to them, lest the spirits be offended. French people believed little elves lived inside them and required daily offerings. As recently as 1630, three women in Hamburg were executed for witchcraft on the grounds that they had mandrake roots in their homes. Arabs call mandrakes the Devil’s candles.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The options to translate “mandrake” are:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. Translate using a similar plant, such as the wild garden egg (so Berom of Nigeria) plus a footnote. In Hausa of Nigeria <i>gautan daji</i> (or <i>yalo</i>) would be a possible model in some places.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. Translate using a functional equivalent, that is, some local plant known as an aid to conception, as Tiv of Nigeria has done (<i>mkehem</i>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. Create a descriptive expression such as “love flower” (<a>CEV</a>) or “love fruit.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>4. Transliterate from Hebrew <i>duda’im</i> or a major language (for example, English (<i>mandaraki</i>), French (<i>mandragore</i>)] and write a footnote saying that this plant may have been considered an aid to conception. When transliterating, it may be useful to add “root of” as a tag, showing that it was the root of the plant that was effective.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0096_marjoram_plant"/></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0620_marjoramflower"/> Zohary, Hepper, and <a>ABD</a> all identify the Hebrew word <i>’ezov</i> as probably referring to <i>Origanum syriacum</i> or <i>Majorana syriaca</i>, better known as “marjoram.” The Septuagint translators decided to use the Greek name <i>hussōpos</i> (“hyssop”), which normally refers to a European plant similar to the marjoram of the Holy Land. Compounding the confusion, some botanists have called the biblical marjoram “Syrian hyssop.” <i>The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia</i> suggests that <i>’ezov</i> may have included various plants. We encourage “marjoram” and hold that the term “Syrian hyssop” is Eurocentric. The words <i>’ezov</i> and <i>hussōpos</i> are cognate. A number of botanists in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries looked at the Arabic word for “caper bush” (<i>el asaf</i>, which became <i>lassaf</i>) and speculated that <i>’ezov</i> in the Pentateuch must refer to the caper bush (see <l target="FLORA:3.5.1">3.5.1 Caper (caper bush, caper berry)</l>), which was plentiful in Egypt and the Arabian Desert. Indeed, a caper bush growing out of a wall in <s>01100501300032</s> (4.33) makes much more sense than a marjoram plant in that environment. <i>’Ezov</i> was required in the Jewish purification ceremonies. Is it possible that as the Hebrews entered the Promised Land, where they found plenty of marjoram, that the ceremony of purification evolved, and that the “legal” definition of <i>’ezov</i> could have generalized to include the marjoram? It is a hairy plant very handy for sprinkling. In the New Testament, then, the word <i>hussōpos</i> in John could plausibly refer to a stalk of the marjoram.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The marjoram plant stands 50–80 centimeters tall (20–32 inches) and has small leaves, and a many-branched, hairy stem. The hairs make it good as a brush. The plant has white flowers. Oil extracted from the leaves and stems is used to scent soaps and lotions.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In Europe and the Middle East today, marjoram is used as a condiment, and it may have been so in Bible times as well, but the biblical use of the plant was as a brush. It was so used by the Israelites in the great Exodus from Egypt, when Moses ordered them to sprinkle blood on their doorposts as a sign to the Angel of Death to pass over their homes. This marked the beginning of the Passover Feast, commemorated ever since by Jews. In <s>01905100900006</s> (7) <i>’ezov</i> is used to symbolize spiritual cleansing. A third, and problematic, reference, occurs in <s>01100501300032</s> (4.33; see the comments below), where <i>’ezov</i> is used to refer to a humble plant that contrasts with the might and grandeur of the cedar of Lebanon.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Many English versions, except for <a>REB</a>, bow under the pressure of tradition and use “hyssop” as the rendering for <i>’ezov</i>. Translators are not obliged to follow suit. If the opportunity arises, they should follow the more scientifically correct “marjoram.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00201202200008</s> a: “Take a bunch of hyssop [<i>’ezov</i> ] and dip it in the blood.” The function of <i>’ezov</i> in Exodus is more important than the plant itself, and even if one uses a transliteration like “branch of esov,” a verb such as “sprinkle” helps to convey the picture. If the translator chooses to substitute a local plant typically used for sprinkling, a footnote is in order. If translators are used to transliterating from English, “marjoram” is preferred, not “hyssop.” On the other hand, a translator can transliterate from Latin <i>majorana</i>, Spanish <i>mejorana</i>, or Arabic <i>mardakush</i>. So some of the options for rendering “marjoram” are the following:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. a generic expression, for example, “leaves”;</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. a transliteration (see above);</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>3. a substitution, that is, a local plant used for sprinkling (plus footnote).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>For translators in West Africa who want to use a plant like marjoram, there are marjoram relatives. One such hairy-leafed plant grows in The Gambia and is used as a mosquito repellent. The Tiv of Nigeria call the same plant <i>huuhuu</i>, and the Etsako of Nigeria refer to it as “mosquito grass.” The leaves have a spicy smell and the plant, being hairy, is good as a kind of brush.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01100501300032</s> a (4.33a): “He [Solomon] spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop [<i>’ezov</i> ] that grows out of the wall.” This verse has three puzzles:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. Marjoram (like the European hyssop) is not a tree. It is a relatively low plant with tiny leaves and white flowers. If the translator has a generic word covering both “trees” and “plants,” that should be used. De Vries holds that the Hebrew word <i>‘ets</i> (“tree”) has wider range of meaning than the English word “tree,” because it includes what we would call vines (see <s>02601500200014</s>). Still, stretching the word <i>‘ets</i> to include a plant like marjoram is expecting quite a bit, which is partly why a few scholars are still unconvinced that <i>’ezov</i> is the marjoram plant. Hepper, for example, is inclined to agree with Tristram and Balfour who, in the late nineteenth century, proposed that <i>’ezov</i> here refers to the caper bush (see <l target="FLORA:3.5.1">3.5.1 Caper (caper bush, caper berry)</l>). Part of their argument rests on cognate evidence: Arabic for the caper bush is <i>lassaf</i> (derived from <i>el asaf</i>), which appears to be cognate with <i>’ezov</i>, but the Arabic word for the marjoram (<i>zaatar</i>) is completely unrelated. Someone could argue that the caper is not a tree either, but, significantly, it does have a woody stem.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. “<i>’Ezov</i> that grows out of the wall” is odd because, in real life, marjoram does not typically grow in the cracks of walls. It likes rocky soil, but is quite unlikely to find its way to walls. Was King Solomon, the great biologist, wrong on a botanical detail that would have been obvious even to school children?</Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>3. Artistically, in this verse, something that grows out of a crack in a wall would make a more striking contrast to the mighty cedar than marjoram would. The caper bush, mentioned above, is an excellent candidate, because it does indeed grow in the cracks of city walls, apart from being a good contrast with the cedar. However, later botanists have not supported this opinion. Also, wider biblical usage votes against it. In Exodus <i>’ezov</i> is used in bunches to sprinkle blood on doorposts. The marjoram, with its hairy stem, is quite suited for such a use. The caper bush is less so. Is it possible that <i>’ezov</i> refers to two different plants in the different contexts? This would not be unprecedented. Zohary, for example, holds that the Hebrew word <i>berosh</i> refers to “cypress” in some contexts and to “fir” in others (see <l target="FLORA:1.6">1.6 Cypress</l>). The same is true of the Hebrew word <i>suf</i>, which can mean “cattail” or “seaweed” (see <l target="FLORA:5.1.1">5.1.1 Cattail (reed-mace)</l>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A final piece of evidence that, unfortunately, does not resolve the issue is that the caper bush is abundant in the desert, whereas marjoram prefers cultivated, moister terrain. There may have been marjoram in Egypt when the Israelites left there, but once in the desert they would not have found it. Were they perhaps forced by necessity to use the caper bush for their sprinkling rituals?</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The following is a summary of translation options for <i>’ezov</i> in <s>01100501300032</s> (4.33):</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>1. transliterate from <i>’ezov</i> (<i>esobu</i>, <i>esofi</i>) or marjoram (<i>marjoramu</i>, <i>macora</i>);</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>2. substitute a local plant that is capable of growing on a wall.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>One possible model for the first half of this verse is “Solomon spoke of all kinds of plants/growing things, even the mighty kedari tree of Lebanon [Mountains], and the [little] majoram/esob/kaper/kafer/asafu that can grow on a city wall.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0290_hemlock"/></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0291_hemlock"/> Zohary suggests that the Hebrew word <i>ro’sh</i> /<i>rosh</i> probably started out as the name of a specific poisonous plant and then was generalized to cover many kinds of plants producing poison. <i>Ro’sh</i> /<i>rosh</i> is often translated “poison” and could have referred to poison conine, derived from Poison Hemlock <i>Conium maculatum</i>. This plant is a member of the carrot family and has no relation to the evergreen tree with the same name. Hepper says that the word <i>ro’sh</i> in <s>02801000400022</s> (“… like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field”) probably does not refer to hemlock, since hemlock does not normally grow in cultivated ground. According to him, this passage refers more likely to Veined Henbane <i>Hyoscyamus reticulatus</i>. Of the ten Old Testament references to <i>ro’sh</i> /<i>rosh</i>, five are translated with the Greek word <i>cholē</i> (“gall”) in the Septuagint. This suggests that <i>ro’sh/rosh</i> was taken as a generic word referring to a bitter, poisonous substance, not necessarily of botanical origin. The <i>ro’sh</i> mentioned in <s>00503203300010</s> is from a snake, the the <i>cholē</i> of Tobit is from a fish (<s>06700600400024 06700600500018 06700600700054</s>, <s>06700600900006</s>; <s>06701100400024</s>, <s>06701100800006</s>, <s>06701101100016</s>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>According to <s>04101502300008</s>, Jesus was offered “wine mingled with myrrh” just before his crucifixion, possibly by his followers, as a sedative. Matthew, seeking to draw a parallel to <s>01906902200010</s> a (“They gave me poison [<i>cholē</i> in the Septuagint] for food”) writes “they offered him wine to drink, mingled with gall” (<s>04002703400012</s>), using the generic Greek word <i>cholē</i> for gall/poison, thus emphasizing the humiliation that the Savior endured.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Poison hemlock can reach 1.5–2.5 meters (5–8 feet) in height. It has a smooth green stem with purple or red streaks toward the bottom. Its leaves are lacy like a carrot’s and up to half a meter (2 feet) long, and it has tiny white flowers grouped in the form of little umbrellas. People mistake it for parsley or wild carrots. Its root is stout and resembles that of European parsnip. Its leaves and root give off a bitter smell.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The biennial henbane has different forms but in general grows a meter (3 feet) or more high, including the flower. It has an erect, branching stem with white flowers in umbrella-shaped heads. The gray-green egg-shaped leaves have sharp tips, may reach 30 centimeters (1 foot) in length, and are covered with sticky hairs.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Poison hemlock was used as a sedative in ancient times by both Greek and Arab doctors, but it was risky since an overdose was fatal or resulted in loss of speech or paralysis. Henbane (meaning “hen-killer”) was used in medicine by the Greeks to induce sleep and to counteract pain. Europeans used it in the Middle Ages and there are Anglo-Saxon works on medicine dating from the eleventh century that mention it under the name “henbell.” Poison derived from hemlock is called “conine.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>All the Old Testament references to <i>ro’sh</i> /<i>rosh</i> are in rhetorical contexts, giving translators freedom to find local words that are powerful. Further, most languages have a word for poison, since it is frequently used in hunting and fishing, or for killing rats. Half of the references are paired with the Hebrew word <i>la‘anah</i> (see <l target="FLORA:5.2.7">5.2.7 Wormwood</l>), so the translator will need to look for a pair of words that fit together. If there is no word for poison, the name of poisonous plants can perhaps be substituted for the pair. Hemlock itself grows throughout central and southern Europe and in Asia and North Africa, and it has been introduced into North and South America. Henbane grows wild throughout central and southern Europe, in western Asia, India and across to Siberia. It now also grows in North and South America, especially in Brazil. A related species of <i>Hyoscyamus</i> is found in the Canary Islands and across North Africa to Asia.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0140_colocynth"/>The young prophet in <s>01200403900036</s> was probably a city dweller. He may not even have had any particular species in mind when he set out to gather “herbs.” What he found was a <i>gefen sadeh</i> (literally “vine of the field”). <i>Gefen</i> is a general Hebrew word for climbing or twining plants but which, like the English word “vine,” can also be used to refer specifically to the grapevine. In this case it was the wild gourd or colocynth, a common vine in dry climates. Its fruit (<i>paqu‘oth</i>) are somewhat poisonous, although in powdered form the gourd was used for medicine. The colocynth gourd still grows in the Jordan Valley near Gilgal, where the story is said to have taken place, as well as in the coastal plain. Hepper informs us that the Roman emperor Claudius was poisoned with colocynth by his wife in 54 <a>A.D.</a> The related Hebrew word <i>peqa‘im</i> occurs elsewhere as the fruit of the bottle gourd (see <l target="FLORA:5.2.1">5.2.1 Bottle gourd</l>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0141_colocynth"/>Hepper suggests that the “vine of Sodom” (<i>gefen sedom</i>) mentioned in the Song of Moses (<s>00503203200006</s>) may have been the Colocynth <i>Citrullus colocynthis.</i> While the comparison is apt, this passage may not refer to a poisonous plant at all but may simply be a way of comparing the rebellious and obstinate Israelites to the wicked people of Sodom. Hepper also says that the colocynth may be the plant referred to by the Hebrew word <i>ro’sh</i> in <s>00502901700070</s>; <s>01906902200010</s>; <s>02400801400044</s>; <s>02400901400038</s>; <s>02402301500032</s>; and <s>03000601200030</s> (see <l target="FLORA:5.2.2">5.2.2 Hammada (Salsola, Salicornia)</l>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The colocynth vine is like a melon, cucumber, or calabash vine. It has a thick, watery root, which can penetrate deep into the ground. Its stems creep on the ground, clinging to bushes or fences with their tendrils. Its leaves are triangular and lobed like melon leaves. Its yellow flowers develop into round yellow fruits the size of a large apple or grapefruit. The shell of the fruit is hard and smooth, and inside is a spongy pulp with white or brown seeds.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The colocynth grows throughout the Mediterranean region and in western Asia. Some translators will lack a generic word for climbing plants, but they may have a more general word “plant.” Alternatively, a phrase such as “wild cucumber” could be used. An important point to remember is that the Hebrew phrase <i>paqu‘oth sadeh</i> (“wild gourds”) in <s>01200403900034</s> is generic and that the young prophet himself did not recognize the fruit. So the story makes most sense if the expression is quite generic. Biblical botanists are fairly sure the vine he discovered was the colocynth, but this is, in a sense, beside the point of the story, since it is intended to demonstrate God’s miraculous power.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Possibilities for the transliteration of “colocynth” are French <i>coloquinthe</i>, Spanish/Portuguese <i>coloquinta</i>, and Arabic <i>banzal</i>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0923_wormwood"/>The Hebrew word <i>la‘anah</i> refers literally to a plant, but it is only used figuratively in the Old Testament, as something representing intense bitterness. Despite very little evidence, commentators and botanists have agreed that this word may refer to a substance derived from the white wormwood bush, which is found abundantly in the the deserts of the Holy Land.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0925_white_wormwood"/>White Wormwood <i>Artemisia herba-alba</i> is a bush less than half a meter (18 inches) high, with finely divided fuzzy leaves. These leaves drop at the end of the cool rainy season of Israel and are replaced with something like scales in the hot season. The flowers appear in clusters of two to four around September/October and mature into small, hairy fruits. When the plant matures, the leaves and flowers are dried to make a very bitter tea, or ground into powder, paste, or oil that is used in medicine.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Most of the references to wormwood in the Old Testament are paired with the Hebrew word for “poison/gall” (<i>ro’sh</i>) and are used metaphorically to represent painful experience and sorrow (see <l target="FLORA:5.2.5">5.2.5 Poison hemlock (black henbane, gall)</l>). In <s>06600801100016 06600801100016</s> a star named Wormwood (<i>apsinthos</i> in Greek) makes a third of the water on earth bitter and poisonous. The leaves of wormwood have a very bitter taste. In small quantities it was used as an anesthetic, and Europeans use it in concocting alcoholic drinks (absinthe, vermouth). It is also used to repel moths and fleas, and as an intestinal worm expeller.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The white wormwood of the Holy Land is found throughout the Middle East, North Africa (Egypt, Morocco) and Southwest Europe, but there are at least 300 species of <i>Artemisia</i> throughout the world, usually in dry areas. A Chinese type (<i>huang huahaosu</i>) is used as medicine against malaria. <i>Artemisia cina</i> and <i>Artemisia maritima</i> are found in Eurasia, where they produce <i>santonica</i>, an anti-worm medicine. <i>Artemisia tilesii</i> is used by the Inuits like codeine. The sagebrush plants of the American West also belong to this genus and were used by Native Americans for various conditions.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Most languages have words for plants that have bitter leaves and/or roots. Since all of the references to wormwood in the Old Testament are metaphorical, these plants can be used to convey the essential component of the passages. As noted above, most of the references to <i>la‘anah</i> are coupled with <i>ro’sh</i>, so the two must be dealt with together in those passages. If particular plants are not available, phrases such as “bitter fruit,” “bitter spice,” or “bitter thing” can be used. If needed, transliterations for wormwood could be based on French <i>absinthe</i>, Portuguese <i>absinto</i>, <i>losna</i>; and Spanish <i>absintio</i>, <i>ajenjo</i>.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>There are probably two or three hundred species of flowering plants in the Bible lands, with 70 or 80 of them being thorny or prickly. Readers are reminded that this book is primarily directed to the needs of translators, so it focuses on the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin words, what they meant, and how they can be translated in a way that preserves both accuracy (in prose contexts) and naturalness (in rhetorical contexts).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Our problems with identifying the flowers and thorns of the Bible are abundant and complex. First, there are a number of words that could refer to a single plant, to a whole class of plants, or to both. Secondly, we try to identify the Hebrew words for plants in the Old Testament and the Greek words in the New Testament, but the analytical picture is skewed by the fact that the New Testament writers, who quoted the Old Testament frequently, used the Greek translation of the Old Testament (the Septuagint), not the original Hebrew. Finally, there is a very human problem: many readers of the Bible, like the tourists who visit the Holy Land, want specifics. They want to hear that this is the plant that Isaiah, or Jesus, was talking about when they said “mustard” or “lily” or “hyssop.” And, of course, some authors, like tour guides, cheerfully tell readers and tourists what they want to hear. Freshly back from his pilgrimage, a man said to me once, “Now I know what the burning bush was.” Such certainty may strengthen faith, but it is academically unsound. We therefore issue a warning here to the reader: Beware of anything in this or any other book on Bible botany that makes it sound as though we know anything about Bible plants with certainty! The best we have (and that in only a few cases) is a general consensus of scholars. In one case, that of the famous “rose of Sharon,” most scholars would say that it is probably not a rose at all! And the “lilies of the valley” may not have been lilies.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>An important fact to keep in mind is that the meanings of words change over time. The time that a book of the Bible was written will determine the interpretation of the words in it. Since we don’t know the date of writing of many books, this makes it difficult to pinpoint meanings of plant names.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Before we go to the Biblical languages, we must point out a potential stumbling block in English. The word “flower” has at least two senses: 1) a plant producing a conspicuous blossom, and 2) the blossom itself, that is, the part of the flowering plant that has the petals.</Paragraph>

Several writers use <i>tsits</i> to picture the short life of human beings (<s>01801400200004 01910301500014 02302800100014 02304000600032 02304000700008 02304000800008</s>). The verbal form (<i>tsuts</i>) is found in <s>00401702300048 02302700600010 02600701000018</s>. The Greek equivalent for this Hebrew word is <i>anthos</i>, which is found in <s>05900101000020 05900101100028</s> and in <s>06000102400022 06000102400036</s> (quoting <s>02304000600032</s>). Did the writers have particular species in mind with the words <i>tsits</i> and <i>anthos</i>? We don’t know, because there are dozens of kinds of flowers that qualify. Of course, this makes it easier for translators since they free to use what is appropriate in the context, as the translators of the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and <a>KJV</a> also did. This is why we find “rose of Sharon” in <s>02200200100004</s> in many versions.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>nets</i> occurs in <s>00104001000024</s>, where the vine in the dream of Pharaoh’s butler puts forth “blossoms.” This word also occurs in <s>02200201200004</s> which speaks of “flowers” appearing on the earth at the time of singing. An abundance of red flowers appears in the spring in the land of the Bible. Interestingly, the Iraqis have a cognate word for this group of flowers (<i>nissan</i>), which, Zohary suggests, supports the proposal that the Hebrew month of Nissan has to do with the appearance of flowers. A related Hebrew noun <i>nitstah</i> is found in <s>01801503300022</s>, where it refers to the blossoms of the olive tree, and in <s>02301800500024</s>, where it refers to the blossoms of the grapevine. A related Hebrew verb <i>natsats</i> (“to blossom”) is found in <s>02101200500022 02200601100034 02200701300026</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Mention should be made also of the Hebrew verb <i>parach</i>, which occurs fourteen times with the sense of “blossom,” and its noun form <i>perach</i>, which occurs fifteen times. One important floral reference that uses <i>perach</i> has to do with the golden lampstand in <s>00202503100006 00202503100018 00202503200018 00202503300066 00202503400008 00202503500060 00202503601000 00202503701000 00202503801000 00202503901000 00202504001000</s>, <s>00203701701000 00203701801000 00203701901000 00203702001000 00203702101000 00203702201000 00203702301000 00203702401000</s>, <s>00400800401000</s>. In those passages the lampstand is compared to a flowering plant with stem and blossoms. The tips of the seven branches are described in Hebrew as <i>perach</i> and in the Septuagint as <i>krinon</i>. This suggests that to the translators of the Septuagint, the Greek word <i>krinon</i> had a general sense of “blossom-shaped object” or “flower.” On the other hand, in <s>01100702600020</s>, where the rim of the Temple’s great bronze water basin is described, the Hebrew text says its brim was like <i>perach shushan</i> (“blossom of <i>shushan</i> ”), and the Septuagint has <i>blastos krinou</i> (“blossom of <i>krinon</i> ”), which might suggest that both <i>shushan</i> and <i>krinon</i> designate a specific type of flower or group of flowers with curved petals (rendered “lily” in <a>RSV</a> and <a>GNB</a>). Further, in <s>02200200101000</s> <i>chavatseleth</i> and <i>shushan</i> are used in parallel, suggesting that each is specific. The issue is pertinent to the interpretation of many other verses where it is unclear if a specific flower is intended or flowers in general, for example, the phrase “lilies of the field” in the Gospels (<s>04000602800016</s>; <s>04201202700006</s>). Matthew and Luke used the Greek word <i>krinon</i>, but it is likely that <i>krinon</i> here is generic, referring to many possible flowers, or some common flower, since there were no true lilies growing “in the fields” at that time. (The white lily grew only in forests.) A few of the species that <i>krinon</i> may have referred to are the crown anemone, scarlet crowfoot, common poppy, crown daisy, and dog chamomile.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek word <i>anthos</i> is found in <s>07000200700020</s>; <s>07102401700016</s>; <s>07103901400016</s>; <s>07105000800004</s>; <s>07105101500004</s>; and <s>07900701600038</s>, where in every case but the first one the meaning is “blossom,” that is, the part of a flowering plant that has petals. <s>07000200700020</s> seems to refer to the entire flowering plant. In <s>07105000800006</s> the species is mentioned, which is the rose (see <l target="FLORA:6.1.4">6.1.4 Rose (Phoenician rose)</l>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Latin word <i>flos</i> is found in <s>08200502400026</s>; <s>08200503600038</s>; <s>08200600300010</s>; <s>08200604400024</s>; <s>08200901700016</s>; <s>08200902400010</s>; <s>08200902600032</s>; <s>08201205100028</s>; and <s>08201505000004</s>, where in most cases it refers to flowering plants in general.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0005_anemone"/>The debate over the “lilies of the field” mentioned by Jesus is endless. The problem many scholars have with “lily” is that the popular “white lily” was not well known and was not a “flower of the field” at the time of Jesus. The Greek word <i>krinon</i> may have been a generic word for many types of lily (as it is in English). One botanist (Smith, of Kew Gardens) claimed that the red Martagon lily was native to the Levant, but this is disputed. <i>Krinon</i> may in fact refer to a broader group of flowers. We can only suggest some of many possibilities. One is the Crown Anemone <i>Anemone coronaria</i>, which blooms profusely in different colors every spring throughout the Mediterranean basin. It belongs to the buttercup family and blooms from January to March.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The anemone plant grows to nearly 50 centimeters (20 inches). It has a thick rhizome or root that stores up nutrients and water and enables the plant to endure drought and dry areas. Its leaves are lacy like a carrot’s, and its flower typically has six big, brightly-colored petals, usually red. They close at night.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>There are around 120 species of anemone around the world, in thirty-five genera. Since the context for this flower is didactic in <s>04000602800016</s> and <s>04201202700006</s>, the translator may wish to substitute an appropriate wildflower, or use the generic phrase “wild flowers.” Like <a>RSV</a>, many English versions still use “lilies of the field” in these passages. <a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, and <a>NAB</a> say “wild flowers,” while <a>ICB</a> has “flowers in the field” (similarly <a>GW</a>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0591_lily"/>The main linguistic support for translating the Hebrew word <i>shushan</i> as “lily” is that its cognates in other languages (Syriac, Coptic, and Arabic) refer to the white lily. White lilies were and still are rare in Israel, and before 1925 many scholars were convinced that they did not exist in the Holy Land. (Two other types of lily are fairly common there.) However, many botanists now believe that <i>shushan</i> could refer to the White Lily <i>Lilium candidum</i>, at least in several contexts. This lily is also known as the Madonna lily due to its frequent association with the Virgin Mary in medieval art and poetry. Zohary believes that the Hebrew word <i>chavatseleth</i> in <s>02200200100010</s> (“rose” in <a>RSV</a>) and <s>02303500100024</s> (“crocus” in <a>RSV</a>) should also be translated as “lily,” but we have reason to disagree with this.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Some scholars have suggested that the <i>shushan</i> adorning the tops of the Temple pillars in <s>01100701900018 01100702200014</s> are white lilies, on the basis of images engraved into the capitals of columns elsewhere in the Ancient Near East. If so, then it is likely that the <i>shushan</i> used later in the same chapter (<s>01100702600022</s>) to describe the downward-curving rim of the great bronze water basin outside the Temple could refer the same plant (also found in <s>01400400500022</s>). In all these cases, any type of lily would have been possible, since they all have distinctive curved petals.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>shushan</i> also occurs in Nehemiah, Esther and Daniel to refer to Susa, the capital city of Persia. Some scholars have written that this name comes from an abundance of lilies found in the area. Others hold that the name comes from “Inshushinak,” the name of the god of the city. This does not necessarily cancel out lilies as the origin of the name; it is a question of what came first.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The word <i>shushan</i> is also found in several Psalm titles (<s>01904500100010 01906000100010 01906900100010 01908000100010</s>), where lilies are appropriate but not necessary to the thought of the passages.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>02801400600020</s> (5) envisions a renewed Israel that “shall blossom as the lily.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>We also find <i>shushan</i> mentioned in the Song of Songs, where the context suggests a broader range of flowers. For example, <s>02200201600020 02200600300022</s> refer to pasturing a flock among the <i>shushan</i> in the field. The botanist Moldenke commends <a>AT</a> for using “hyacinths” here, a flower blue in color. But it could as well be the crown anemone, the common poppy, or some other flower that blankets the valleys and pastures in the springtime. The third line of <s>02200501300018</s> reads “His lips are <i>shoshanim</i>.” Some suggest that the red color is the ground of comparison here, so Ariel and Chana Bloch translate “his lips [are] red lilies.” However, as Murphy points out, “The use of the flower here may have less to do with the color of the man’s lips than with the delight they provide” (page 166). In <s>02200700300030</s> (3) the woman is wearing a string of <i>shushan</i> around her waist. They could have been almost any flower, but presumably would have been an abundant one. So, in practice, if not in theory, we recommend a generic expression such as “beautiful flowers” in these verses.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Greek word <i>krinon</i> in <s>04000602800016 04201202700006</s> is now thought to refer to the crown anemone, the common poppy, or to a whole class of plants (see <l target="FLORA:6.1.1">6.1.1 Anemone (crown anemone)</l>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0592_lily"/>Latin inherited the word <i>lilium</i> from Greek, and references to it in <s>08200201900030 08200502400034</s> are generic. It is uncertain what type of lily is in view in these passages since the context is apocalyptic. In <s>08200201900030</s> lilies are paired with roses (see <l target="FLORA:6.1.4">6.1.4 Rose (Phoenician rose)</l>).</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Translators who are convinced that <i>shushan</i> refers to a specific flower can use local species, if there is one, or substitute a cultural equivalent. Lilies are known throughout the world both as wildflowers and as cultivated flowers. Many translators will prefer to use “flower” or a phrase such as “beautiful flower,” as some common language versions have done. Transliteration is not advised in the poetical passages. In Song of Songs English versions generally say “lily/lilies,” but <a>FRCL</a> has “anemone[s]” and <i>La Biblia: Traducción en Lenguaje Actual</i> uses “rose[s].”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0171_daffodil"/><s>02303500100022</s> says that the renewed Israel will blossom “like <i>chavatseleth</i>.” The same Hebrew word occurs in <s>02200200100004</s>, where the young woman describes herself as “<i>chavatseleth</i> of Sharon” (the famous “rose of Sharon”), and a number of botanists take both references to be the Narcissus <i>Narcissus tazetta</i>. Murphy adds asphodel to the possibilities. Still others take both references to be to the crocus, the mountain tulip, or the white lily (Madonna lily). We are following Moldenke in distinguishing the rather different contexts of Isaiah and Song of Songs by proposing the narcissus (or daffodil) in <s>02303500100022</s> and the tulip in <s>02200200100004</s> (see <l target="FLORA:6.1.5">6.1.5 Tulip (mountain tulip, “rose of Sharon”)</l>). The narcissus, like the tulip, grows plentifully on the Plain of Sharon between Caesarea and Joppa (now Tel Aviv) as well as elsewhere throughout Israel, and indeed, across Asia all the way to China. It is a popular, fragrant flower that people love to use for bouquets. It blooms in early spring.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Although <i>Narcissus</i> is a genus with many species within it, including daffodils and what North Americans call “jonquils,” many people also associate “narcissus” with a particular species almost identical to the daffodil. All of them grow to a height of 30–45 centimeters (12–18 inches) and have long, flat, narrow leaves. The root of the narcissus is a bulb like that of an onion, and the flower usually has six lovely creamy-white petals radiating from a bright yellow funnel-like center. The stem bends just before the blossom, so the blossom faces out or down rather than up.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Isaiah apparently uses <i>chavatseleth</i> to describe the new community in the renewed land of Israel, where the desert will turn into acres of brightly colored flowers. The narcissus fits this perfectly. The flower is named after Narcissus, a young man in Greek mythology. His name has also given us the Greek word <i>narkē</i> “numb” from which we also get the word narcotic. For the Greeks, Narcissus stood for vanity, since Narcissus did not respond to the love of others and preferred to gaze at his reflection in a pool of water. The yellow daffodil is the national flower of Wales, where people wear it on Saint David’s Day (March 1). In China it is a common decoration flower during the New Year festival.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>English versions vary widely in their rendering of <i>chavatseleth</i> in <s>02303500100022</s>. <a>RSV</a>, <a>NRSV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, and <i>The Message</i> have “crocus”; <a>NEB</a> and <a>REB</a> have “asphodel”; <a>KJV</a>, <a>NKJV</a>, and <a>NJPSV</a> have “rose”; <a>GW</a> has “lily”; while <a>GNB</a>, <a>CEV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, and <a>NCV</a> use the generic word “flowers.” Translators in Europe, North America, and Asia will know the narcissus or daffodil. Since many scholars feel <i>chavatseleth</i> may equally have been the crocus, narcissus, tulip, or the Madonna lily, translators who find one of those in a major language near them may wish to transliterate, although we do not generally recommend transliteration in poetic passages. Preferably, the translator will substitute a flower that carries the same emotive effect, or use a descriptive phrase such as “abundant, beautiful flowers.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0116_rose_phoenician"/>The Greek word <i>rodon</i> in the Deuterocanon is generally agreed to refer to the Phoenician Rose <i>Rosa phoenicia</i>. This rose originated in the area of Turkey and is also found in Lebanon and northern Iraq. The genus to which it belongs stretches from western Europe across to the mountains of Nepal and into China. However, Moldenke considers the word <i>rodon</i> in Sirach to refer to Oleander <i>Nerium oleander</i>. In our view both flowers are equally possible.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The Phoenician rose is a prickly plant with a woody stem that can reach 1–2 meters (3–7 feet). It has vine-like branches with small, hooked thorns. Its leaves are very small and hairy with toothed edges. Its flowers are abundant, small and white, with a fragrant smell. When the petals drop, the seeds are left in a round fruit that is called a “hip.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0105_oleander_flowers"/>The oleander shrub has been cultivated in warm countries for many centuries. It grows abundantly in the Jordan Valley and along streams elsewhere in Israel. It reaches 2–4 meters (7–13 feet) in height and has thickly leaved branches and profuse pink flowers. Its leaves are narrow and about eight centimeters (three inches) long. Both the leaves and the flowers exude a poisonous milky resin.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Roses have been popular for thousands of years. The Egyptians cultivated them as early as 2000 <a>B.C.</a>, and the Romans at the time of Christ were so fond of them that the writer Horace worried that farmers were neglecting their olive groves because of roses. They cooked and made wine with the petals; they bathed with rose-scented oils. Europeans have taken the passion for roses even further, as they develop ever stranger genetic combinations of roses, until we now have hundreds of cultivated varieties. People elsewhere have used parts of roses in medicine and in hot drinks, using the globular “hip” left when the petals wither. The references in Sirach clearly suggest that roses were valued for their beauty.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Since the contexts of the references in Sirach are rhetorical in every case, translators should preferably look for a local equivalent that represents beauty and fragrance. If emotive impact is of less concern, a descriptive expression can be used, such as “beautiful flower,” or a name from a major language can be transliterated, for example, <i>rosa</i> (Spanish), <i>warda</i> (Arabic), or <i>mugunga</i> /<i>jangmi</i> (Korean). In <s>08200201900026</s> “roses” are paired with “lilies” (see <l target="FLORA:6.1.2">6.1.2 Lily (white lily, Madonna lily)</l>), so these flowers need to be handled in the same way.</Paragraph>

              <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0133_tulip"/> In <s>02200200100004</s> the woman describes herself as “a rose [<i>chavatseleth</i> in Hebrew] of Sharon, a lily [<i>shushan</i> ] of the valleys.” Sharon is a fertile plain along the Mediterranean coast between Mount Carmel and Joppa. Most botanists agree that the “rose” of Sharon is not a rose, despite persistence of that name to the present time in English versions (for example, <a>RSV</a>, <a>CEV</a>, <a>NIV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, <a>NJB</a>, <a>NJPSV</a>). The Hebrew word <i>chavatselah</i> may be related to the verb <i>batsal</i>, meaning “to form a bulb,” and this has suggested a variety of possibilities that include the crocus, narcissus (daffodil), tulip, and Madonna lily. The unopened flower of these plants is indeed a bulb-shaped bud before it opens up and the petals curve out. The same word is found in <s>02303500100024</s>, where we read that the renewed Israel will “blossom like the <i>chavatseleth</i>.” The parallel reference in <s>02801400600020</s> b (5; “he shall blossom as the <i>shushan</i> ”) might suggest that <i>chavatseleth</i> is clearly synonymous with the true lily. However, we have argued above that <i>shushan</i> may in fact have a general sense (see <l target="FLORA:6.1.3">6.1.3 Lily (white lily, Madonna lily)</l>) and that <i>chavatseleth</i> in <s>02303500100024</s> refers to the narcissus/daffodil (see <l target="FLORA:6.1.3">6.1.3 Narcissus (daffodil)</l>). So in <s>02200200100004</s> we are left with three other possibilities: the saffron crocus, the narcissus/daffodil, and the tulip (either the mountain tulip or the Sharon tulip). (Incidentally, commercial florists have added to the confusion by naming two other species of flower “rose of Sharon.” One is actually a hybiscus; the other, a hypericum.) Following Professor Hareuveni of the Hebrew University and the botanist Moldenke, we favor the Mountain Tulip <i>Tulipa montana</i> for <i>chavatseleth</i> in <s>02200200100004</s>, with the Sharon Tulip <i>Tulipa agenensis</i> as a close second (some botanists hold them to be the same species).</Paragraph>

So <a>GNB</a> renders the first line as “I am only a wild flower in Sharon.” Translators may consider using a local species with the same characteristics.

          <Heading>We have about twenty names in Hebrew and Greek for thorny and prickly plants in the Bible, and at least seventy or eighty thorny and prickly plants in the Bible lands. Trying to match them is even more hopeless than it is for flowers. In some cases the word was probably not attached to a specific plant in the first place. But we do not even know for sure which ones are generic. If the frequency of use implies generality, the Hebrew word <i>qots</i> and the Greek word <i>akantha</i> are the most general words for thorny and prickly plants.</Heading>
          <SubHeading />
          <LanguageSets />
          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>In most cases we simply don’t know which of the many spiny plants they could refer to. We have already included the boxthorn (<i>Lycium europaeum</i>) and Christ thorn (<i>Ziziphus spina-christi</i>) in our discussion on wild trees and shrubs (see <l target="FLORA:1.2">1.2 Boxthorn</l>). Here we deal with various others. Whatever we may know about these Bible plants is based on two sources of information: 1) paleo-botany, that is, studies of what plants probably grew in the Middle East in ancient times, and 2) cognate words in related languages. We look at cognates because, even after Hebrew passed out of common usage for some centuries, the Arabic and Syriac names, often similar, may have carried on into the present, giving us clues to what the Hebrew may have referred to.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Up to this point we have not included discussion of plants used as place names or personal names, but it is worth noting that thorns have a place in these categories. For example, in <s>00100402300012</s> “Adah” and “Zillah,” the wives of Lamech, are the names of thorny plants. That this may have affected their personality and behavior is left to the reader to decide. In any case, it would not have been missed by Hebrew hearers of the Lamech story. Likewise, the Hebrew name “Shamir” means “thorny,” although the word is rendered “diamond” or “adamant” in some contexts (for example, <s>02401700100018</s>). The Hebrew word <i>qots</i>, which means “thornbush,” occurs in the names Koz and Hakkoz, who are men mentioned in 1 Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Biologists make a sharp distinction between thorns, spines, and prickles. Thorns evolve from branches and spines from leaves. Prickles are usually tiny projections on leaves, especially on smaller plants. In English we also use “thorn” to refer to a thorn-bearing tree or shrub. Thistles are flowering plants from various genera having leaves with sharp prickles on the edges. Most of them are from the <i>Asteraceae</i> family. Nettles belong to the genus <i>Urtica</i> and almost all have stinging hairs on their stems and leaves. The sting is caused by a toxin secreted by the plant. We will comment on the technical meanings of “brier” and “bramble” below.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>The context of certain verses suggests that some biblical plants may have been thistles. They go especially under three names in Hebrew: <i>barqan</i>, <i>dardar</i>, and <i>choach</i>. However, other Hebrew words such as <i>galgal</i>, <i>sirah</i> and <i>qots</i> may have referred to thistles as well. The following may have been some of the thistles referred to in Scripture:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0131_thistle_tumble"/>The <b>Tumble Thistle</b><i>Gundelia tournefortii</i> is a widespread thistle in the Middle East, and the young tender plants are eaten as a vegetable in early spring. However, as the plant matures, the leaves become dry and sharp. Further, the whole plant becomes round, and at a certain point the stem breaks and the plant becomes a “tumbleweed,” rolling and bouncing in the wind, at the same time scattering its seeds. The plant is called <i>akub</i> or <i>ka’aub</i> in Arabic. The place name “Akov” may come from this plant.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew word <i>galgal</i> in <s>01908301400010 02301701300048</s> could refer to the tumble thistle or the Prickly Saltwort <i>Salsola kali</i> (also called Russian thistle or tumbleweed; see <l target="FLORA:5.2.2">5.2.2 Hammada (Salsola, Salicornia)</l>). Like the tumble thistle, the prickly saltwort is round and breaks loose when it dries up, rolling and tumbling before a strong wind.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0868_milk_thistle"/>The <b>Milk Thistle</b><i>Silybum marianum</i> is also called Mary’s thistle, holy thistle, or variegated thistle. It is found in southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It can grow annually or biennially. It grows 1–2 meters (3–7 feet) in height and has large waxy, lobed leaves with sharp spines as in other thistles. Its flower heads, one per stalk, have tiny pink or purple florets bunched together to form the flower. A chemical (silymarin) extracted from the seeds of this thistle is believed to enhance liver function. It is used to treat liver cirrhosis, hepatitis, and gallbladder disorders. Related species of <i>Silybum</i> are found in North and South America.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0869_syrian_thistle"/>The <b>Syrian Thistle</b><i>Notobasis syriaca</i> is native to the Mediterranean region, from the Canary Islands across Morocco and eastward to Egypt, Iran, and Azerbaijan. It also grows on the Mediterranean coast of Europe. According to Zohary, this thistle could have been the <i>barkan</i> with which Gideon whipped the elders of the town of Succoth (<s>00700800700052 00700801600030</s>). The Syrian thistle is an annual plant growing to a meter (3 feet) tall. Its leaves are arranged spirally and are deeply lobed, gray-green with white veins with sharp spines on the edges and tip. Its flowers have purple petals surrounded by sharp spines.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0867_thistle_golden"/>The <b>Golden Thistle</b><i>Scolymus maculatus</i> is also called the common thistle or oyster thistle. It is an annual or perennial plant that grows to a meter (3 feet) tall. It has a bright yellow flower. As with other thistles, it has leaves with sharp spines on the edges.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><Image Id="PTZ-0130_thistle_globe"/>The <b>Iberian Thistle</b><i>Centaurea iberica</i> is also called the star thistle or Spanish thistle. Zohary suggests that the Hebrew word <i>dardar</i> could refer to this thistle, but it does not occur as a weed in the fields and does not fit the context of <s>00100301800008</s>. Hepper suggests instead the Slender Safflower <i>Carthamus tenuis</i>, Crete eryngo <i>Eryngium creticum</i>, Upright Rest Harrow <i>Ononis antiquorum</i>, or Field Prosopis <i>Prosopis farcta</i>. Other possible candidates are the tumble thistle, Globe Thistle <i>Echinops adenocaulus</i>, and Cotton Thistle <i>Onopordum cynarocephalum</i>.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Translators in French-speaking areas may know thistles as <i>artichout sauvage</i> (“wild artichoke”); in Portuguese they are called <i>cardo leiteiro</i>; in Spanish, <i>cardo de Maria</i> or <i>cardo lechero</i>. It is possible that thistles will be known to translators in some areas. If not, any obnoxious plant, particularly if it has thorns or prickles, will suffice.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Translators need to know that a phrase like “thorns and thistles” is a rhetorical device called a “doublet” intended to emphasize the thorniness of the scene described, for example the unpleasant outcome of Adam’s tragic choice in the garden of Eden (<s>00100301800008</s>) or the punishment of Samaria’s idol worshipers (<s>02801000800018</s>). Since these are rhetorical passages, translators should try to convey the intensity of the whole phrase. The identity of the Hebrew plants is not in focus. If well-known specific words for thorn plants are lacking, one can get the negative idea by a phrase such as “prickly and obnoxious plants” or “thorns of every kind.” Also, in the absence of prickly plants, any sort of plant considered destructive by farmers will do. Note the variety in English versions at <s>00100301800008</s>: <a>NJB</a> “brambles and thistles”; <a>GNB</a> “weeds and thorns.”</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0674_nettleball"/> There are thirty to forty-five species of nettles belonging to the family <i>Urtica</i>, which is found mainly in temperate regions of the world. Three are common in Israel and probably were there in Bible times: the Tailed Nettle <i>Urtica caudata</i> (= <i>Urtica membranacea</i>), the Roman Nettle <i>Urtica pilulifera</i> (“little ball nettle”) and the Dwarf Nettle <i>Urtica urens</i> (“burning nettle”). Nettles are mostly perennial plants, with stinging hairs. People who have experienced the sting appreciate that the Hebrew roots <i>s-r-f</i> and <i>ch-r-h</i> both mean “burning” or “scorching.” The Arabic name for one type of nettle is <i>chorreig</i> in Israel and <i>sorbei</i> in Egypt.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>All the references cited above are in rhetorical contexts where the quality of thorniness or pain is in focus. Nettles were and are a nuisance on many farms. They tend to sprout in abandoned settlements, and they are often cited with jackals and owls to illustrate the desolation of a nation by their enemies. Today the tops of the growing nettles are used for food in many places. Extracts from nettles are used to treat arthritis and hay fever and as an ingredient of shampoos to control dandruff.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
              <Paragraph>We bring together here nine Hebrew words, five Greek words, and one Latin word. We would have included the Hebrew word <i>‘atad</i> here, but since it is tree-sized, we have included it in Chapter 1 (see <l target="FLORA:1.2">1.2 Boxthorn</l>). Also, the Hebrew word <i>barqan</i> could have been treated here, but we have taken it to refer to thistles (see <l target="FLORA:6.2.1">6.2.1 Thistles</l>). Hepper suggests that <i>barqan</i> could have referred to branches of the boxthorn. The Hebrew and Greek words discussed below are usually translated “thorn,” “bramble,” or “brier” in English. The words “brier” and “bramble” have technical usages. Bramble technically refers to thorny plants in the rose family (genus <i>Rubus</i>), and it includes blackberries and raspberries, both common as food plants in Europe and North America. Brier can refer to a type of rose with pink flowers, also called the sweetbrier or eglantine, or to a prickly vine in the eastern United States called the bullbrier, greenbrier, and other names.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>chedeq</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In both references to this Hebrew word there is an association with a fence or hedge (<i>mesukah</i>). The first line of <s>02001501900010</s> says literally “The way of a sluggard is like a hedge of thorns [<i>chedeq</i> ].” The first line of <s>03300700400006</s> says “The best of them is like a brier [<i>chedeq</i> ],” which is parallel to “the most upright of them a thorn hedge.” <s>02300500500026</s> mentions a vineyard with a hedge. This hedge may have been made of stones, but may well have been topped with thorny branches of spiny burnet or Christ thorn. <s>02800200800016</s> (6) refers to God hedging the path of wayward Israel with “thorns” (<i>sirah</i>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>na‘atsuts</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This Hebrew word occurs twice in Isaiah. In <s>02300701900038</s> we read that flies and bees will settle on “thornbushes” (<i>na‘atsuts</i>). Later in the vision of the new Israel, <s>02305501300008</s> says beautiful cypress trees will replace thornbushes (<i>na‘atsuts</i>), and fragrant myrtle shrubs will replace briers (<i>sirpad</i>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>sirah</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Two passages where this Hebrew word occurs are <s>02100700600010</s> (“For as the crackling of thorns [<i>sirah</i> ] under a pot …”) and <s>02800200800016</s> (“Therefore I will hedge up her way with thorns [<i>sirah</i> ] …”). According to Zohary, <i>sirah</i> could refer to the Thorny or Spiny Burnet <i>Sarcopoterium spinosum</i>. A related Arabic word <i>sir</i> /<i>thir</i> is still used for hedging and as fuel for cooking and for lime kilns.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>sallon</i> /<i>sillon</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Both references to this Hebrew word are from Ezekiel. In <s>02600200600032</s> it is in a doublet with <i>sarav</i>: “… though briers [<i>sarav</i> ] and thorns [<i>sallon</i> ] are with you … .” In <s>02602802400016</s> we read that in the new Israel “there shall be no more a brier [<i>sillon</i> ] to prick or a thorn [<i>qots</i> ] to hurt them.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>tsen</i>, <i>tseninim</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This singular Hebrew word <i>tsen</i> occurs two times with a botanical meaning; it is found also in <s>03000400200030</s> with the meaning “hook.” In <s>02002200500002</s> a we read “Thorns [<i>tsen</i> ] and snares are in the way of the perverse.” Hepper suggests that here we may have the True Bramble (Blackberry) <i>Rubus sanguineus</i> (French <i>mûre</i>, <i>mûrier</i>; Spanish <i>zarza</i>). <s>01800500500016</s> says “His harvest the hungry eat, and he takes it even out of thorns [<i>tsen</i> ] … .” See below for discussion of this difficult verse. The plural Hebrew word <i>tseninim</i> is used in <s>00403305500044 00602301300066</s> in a metaphorical sense: the enemies of Israel will be like thorns in the Israelites’ bodies.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>qots</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This is probably the most general of the Hebrew words for thorn, occurring twelve times, including six times in doublets with <i>barqan</i>, <i>dardar</i>, <i>sillon</i>, or <i>shamir</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>sek</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The only place we find this Hebrew word is in <s>00403305500044</s>, where we read that the inhabitants of Canaan “will be as pricks [<i>sek</i> ] in your eyes and as thorns (<i>tseninim</i> ] in your sides.” However, several related words give us clues to the meaning of <i>sek</i>: <i>sukkah</i> refers to a harpoon in <s>01804003100008</s>, and <i>sakkin</i> means “knife.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>shayith</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This Hebrew word occurs seven times, always as a doublet with <i>shamir</i>, and only in Isaiah.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>shamir</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This Hebrew word occurs eight times in Isaiah with a botanical meaning, seven of which are in parallel with <i>shayith</i>. <a>RSV</a> usually translates the doublet as “briers [<i>shamir</i> ] and thorns [<i>shayith</i> ].” In <s>02301001700030</s> the order of these Hebrew words is reversed, so <a>RSV</a> has “thorns and briers.” <a>RSV</a> translates <i>shamir</i> as “diamond” or “adamant,” a type of hard stone, in <s>02401700100018</s>, <s>02401700100018</s>; <s>02600300900004</s>; and <s>03800701200008</s>. The name “Shamir” occurs in <s>00601504800010</s> and <s>00701000100040 00701000200028</s> as a place name and in <s>01302402400016</s> as a personal name.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>akantha</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This Greek word occurs in <s>04000701600020</s> b, which asks “Are grapes gathered from thorns [<i>akantha</i> ] or figs from thistles [<i>tribolos</i> ]?” Interestingly, the parallel passage in <s>04200604400024</s> keeps <i>akantha</i>, but substitutes <i>batos</i> (“bramble bush”) for <i>tribolos</i>. In <s>05800600800006</s> <i>akantha</i> is in a doublet again with <i>tribolos</i><i>Akantha</i> also occurs in the story of the sower (<s>04001300700012 04001300700012 04001302200010 04100400700012 04100400700012 04100401800014 04200800700014 04200800700014 04200801400010</s>). In <s>04002702900010 04301900200014</s> “a crown of thorns [<i>akantha</i> ]” is placed on Jesus’ head. Scholars have speculated for centuries over what species <i>akantha</i> refers to in these verses. Linnaeus was so convinced that it must be the Syrian Christ Thorn <i>Ziziphus spina-christi</i> that he made “Christ-thorn” the species name. Others, particularly Hebrew botanists, argue for the Spiny Burnet <i>Sarcopoterium spinosum</i> on the grounds that the soldiers would have taken the most available thorny plant. It could also have been the <i>Paliurus spina-christi</i>, the Lotus Thorn <i>Ziziphus lotus</i>, or the Boxthorn <i>Lycium shawii</i> (see <l target="FLORA:1.2">1.2 Boxthorn</l>). We believe that Matthew and John were not interested in the particular bush that the thorns came from, so they used a general word here.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>akanthinos</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This Greek word is derived from <i>akantha</i>. It is used of the crown of thorns in <s>04101501700018 04301900500016</s>. It seems to be a generic word, meaning “thorny” or “made of thorns.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>batos</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The famous burning bush in <s>00200300201024 00200300301000 00200300401000</s> (<i>seneh</i> in Hebrew) is rendered by the Greek word <i>batos</i> in the Septuagint, and that word is used in the retelling of the story in <s>04101202600030 04202003700022 04400703000034 04400703500058</s> (see <l target="FLORA:1.4">1.4 Burning bush</l>). The only clue that this might have been a thorny plant is that Luke uses it in parallel with <i>akantha</i> in <s>04200604400024</s> b: “For figs are not gathered from thorns [<i>akantha</i> ], nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush [<i>batos</i> ].”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>ramnos</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>07300107000016</s> (71), a passage that echoes <s>02401000501000</s>, the Greek word <i>ramnos</i> refers to a bush that birds land on. How did the translators of <a>RSV</a> know it was a “thorn bush”? It is possible that they used “thorn bush” for <i>ramnos</i> in <s>07300107000016</s> because the Septuagint translators used <i>ramnos</i> to translate the Hebrew word for “bramble” (<i>‘atad</i>) in <s>00700901401000 00700901501000</s> (see <l target="FLORA:1.2">1.2 Boxthorn</l>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>tribolos</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>This Greek word only occurs in <s>04000701600020 05800600800006</s>, where it is rendered “thistles.” In both passages it is paired with <i>akantha</i>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><i>spina</i></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In <s>08201603300032 08201607800036</s> the Latin word <i>spina</i> is used to refer to thorns growing on the roads of a deserted land. The context requires a general word that implies a bush that blocks the road so people cannot pass easily.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>As in the case of thistles and nettles, the contexts for other thorny plants are usually rhetorical, and translators need to be free to use appropriate cultural equivalents. In many cases doublets are involved (for example, “thorns and thistles,” “thorns and briers”) or synonyms in parallel lines. In many languages there may not be nearly as many words in the semantic domain “thorny plants” to choose from as there are in Hebrew, so translators will have to use their vocabulary more than once, trying to be concordant where possible.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>00700800701040 00700801600018</s>: Two problems arise in these verses. First, the identity of the plant(s) referred to and second, the meaning of the Hebrew verb rendered “flail” (<i>dush</i>). Gideon promises to punish the people of Succoth by flailing their flesh with “thorns” (<i>qots</i>) and “briers” (<i>barqan</i>). The Hebrew verb <i>dush</i> occurs elsewhere with the meaning “thresh,” “trample,” or “beat.” It is unclear here whether Gideon is simply threatening to beat the people of Succoth with thorny branches, or using a metaphor, saying, in effect, “I’m going to deal with your bodies as a farmer threshes/beats his grain at harvest time, only I will use thorny branches.” It must be remembered that threshing was and is done in many ways—by beating the grain with sticks, by having donkeys and oxen tread on it, or by dragging a sledge over it. In the development of agriculture, we can assume that beating by hand came first, followed by having animals trample the grain, and finally, the invention of the sledge, and that the verb <i>dush</i> started with the sense of “beat” and then took on the more specific meanings as the technology changed. The threshing sledge had protrusions on the underside which crushed the grain and made the outer shell come off (see <a>WTH</a>, <l target="REALIA:1.1.8.2">1.1.8.2 Threshing board, sledge</l>). So some commentators have suggested that <i>barqan</i> here may actually refer to a sledge. However, the simplest solution is often the best, and Gideon’s threat is probably adequately translated by a verb that means “beat” (<a>GNB</a>) or “whip” (<a>NCV</a>, <a>GW</a>), rather than by “trample” (<a>NRSV</a>), “thresh” (<a>NJPSV</a>), or “flail” (<a>RSV</a>, <a>REB</a>). Translating <i>dush</i> as “tear” (<a>NIV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, <a>NKJV</a>) seems to be going beyond the normal semantic range of that word. Still, the use of “your flesh/bodies” instead of simply “you” raises the possibility that the writer intends something other than just “beat someone with a tool.” So translations following <a>NIV</a>, <a>NLT</a>, and <a>NKJV</a> also have some merit.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><s>01800500500016</s>: This verse is about God giving rich people their just reward by letting poor people inherit their wealth. The second line seems to say “they will take [the rich man’s] harvest, even from among thorns [<i>tsinnim</i>, plural of <i>tsen</i> ].” Commentators who take <i>tsinnim</i> as thorns here picture either thorny places on the edge of the field, where seed has fallen (so <a>GNB</a>, <a>NCV</a>, <a>GW</a>; see <s>04001300700012</s>) or perhaps a field surrounded by a thorn hedge, which was very common. In the latter case, the sense is that the poor people will even penetrate a thorny fence to take the rich man’s grain (so <a>NLT</a>, <a>FRCL</a>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Various commentators have considered the above situation strange, and have assumed that a word other than “thorns” was intended by the writer. <a>REB</a> and <a>NJPSV</a> take <i>tsinnim</i> as a plural for <i>tsinna’</i> (“basket/pannier”). <a>NJPSV</a> says “carrying it off in baskets,” and <a>REB</a> has “stronger men seize it from the panniers.” “Stronger men” here results from taking the Hebrew word <i>’el</i> as “strong man” rather than as the preposition “to.” Others, using different emendations, have translated this line as “and carry away to hiding places” (Dhorme), “he takes it to the famished” (Guillaume), “or God shall take it away by blight” (<a>NAB</a>, using square brackets), and “God snatches it from their mouths” (<a>NJB</a>). The Septuagint, perhaps following a different text, has “but they shall not be delivered out of calamities.” A number of commentators take this line as untranslatable and delete it. The Jewish commentator Moshe Eisemann adds this bit of explanation: The poor gleaners in the picture are not in a hurry. They take their time gleaning, even taking the grain from the thorny places or from behind thorn hedges, because they have no fear of being chased away. With this in mind, I recommend staying with “thorns” by following <a>GNB</a> and <a>NCV</a> or <a>NLT</a> and <a>FRCL</a>.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph><Image Id="WEB-0174_darnel"/><s>04001302500026</s> speaks of enemies sowing weeds (or tares) in with the wheat seed. Although the land of the Bible does not lack noxious weeds in the fields, the best candidate for the Greek word <i>zizanion</i> is Darnel Grass <i>Lolium temulentum</i>. Evidence from Egyptian tombs and from excavations at Lachish tells us that darnel grass has been a pest for at least three millennia. It looks so much like emmer wheat that it is very difficult to distinguish the two.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The Hebrew noun <i>ba’ashah</i> occurs only in <s>01803104000016</s>, but its verbal form occurs many times in the Old Testament with the meaning “to stink” like that of a rotting sore or a corpse. This noun does not actually refer to a plant; it literally means “stinking thing.” However, in <s>01803104010000</s> it is parallel with the Hebrew word <i>choach</i> (“thistle”; see <l target="FLORA:6.2.1">6.2.1 Thistles</l>), so it has the sense of “stinking/unpleasant weed” in this context. One lexicon takes it to refer to a particular plant called “stinkweed,” but it has a more generic sense here, referring to any stinking weeds.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>Translators in agricultural areas will have no difficulty understanding the biblical farmer’s frustration with nasty weeds. Darnel grass is so well known that it generates a lot of names (for example, French <i>herbe a couteau</i>, <i>herbe d’ivrogue</i>, <i>ivraie</i>; Spanish <i>barrachuela</i>, <i>cizaña</i>, <i>cominillo</i>, <i>joyo</i>, <i>trigollo</i>; Portuguese <i>joio</i>). Translators who are out of touch with the rural, agricultural scene need to consult farmers for possible names. A cultural equivalent to the “false wheat” of the Bible may exist. Otherwise a phrase such as “false wheat” could be used in the parable of the weeds.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph>This Glossary contains terms that are technical from an exegetical or linguistic viewpoint. Other terms not defined here may be found in a Bible dictionary.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>ADVERB</b> is a word that limits, describes, or qualifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. In English “quickly,” “soon,” “primarily,” and “very” are adverbs.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>AMBIGUITY</b> refers to words or sentences that have more than one possible meaning in a given context. For example, in the sentence “Mike said that if Joe comes, he will speak to the president,” “he” could refer to Mike or to Joe. Thus this sentence is <b>AMBIGUOUS</b>. Often what is ambiguous in written form is not ambiguous when actually spoken, since intonation and other features of speech help to make the meaning clear. In written discourse, context also helps to indicate which meaning is intended by the author.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>APHRODISIAC</b> refers to substances, often plants or parts of plants that are believed to enhance sexual desire.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>APOCALYPTIC</b> refers to a prophetic revelation concerning the end of the temporal world; for example, the book of Revelation is an apocalyptic writing.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The <b>APOCRYPHA</b> is a group of books included in the Greek <b>SEPTUAGINT</b> and the Old Testament of the Latin <b>VULGATE</b> but not in the <b>PROTOCANON</b> of the Hebrew canon. See also <b>DEUTEROCANON</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>ARAMAIC</b> is a <b>SEMITIC</b> language that was widely used in Southwest Asia in lands east of the Mediterranean Sea before and during the time of Christ. It is related to <b>HEBREW</b> and in many contexts had replaced Hebrew in use among the Jewish people in the land of Israel at the time of the New Testament.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>ARCHEOLOGY (ARCHAEOLOGICAL</b>) refers to the study from materials from the past that are dug up or that are found and interpreted to explain life in earlier times. This evidence may lend support to written documents or may give us information to help us understand the text as well as the people of the days when the text was written.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>AROMATIC</b> refers to the leaves or resin of certain trees that produces a pleasing smell, such as mint, marjoram, or eucalyptus.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>ARTICLE</b> is a grammatical class of words, often obligatory, which indicate whether the word to which it is connected is definite or indefinite. In English the <b>DEFINITE ARTICLE</b> is “the,” and the indefinite article is “a” or “an.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>BORROWING</b> is the process of using a foreign word in another language. For example, “matador” is a Spanish word that has been <b>BORROWED</b> by English speakers for “bullfighter.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>CALYX</b> is the outside part of a flower, usually green in color, which forms a cup-like structure into which the petals and other parts of the flower fit. In the pomegranate, the petals drop, leaving the calyx as part of the fruit.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>CHIASMUS</b>, or <b>CHIASTIC STRUCTURE</b> is a reversal of words or phrases in the second part of an otherwise parallel construction; for example:</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A I</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>B was shapen</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>C in iniquity</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>C' in sin</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>B' did my mother conceive</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A' me.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>CLASSIFIER</b> is a term used with another term (often a proper noun) to indicate to what category the latter belongs. “Town” may serve as a classifier in the phrase “town of Bethlehem,” and “river” as a classifier in “river Jordan.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>CLAUSE</b> is a grammatical construction, normally consisting of a subject and a predicate.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>COMMON LANGUAGE VERSION</b> uses language that is widely understood and accepted by most speakers. In such a translation, substandard speech, dialect peculiarities, and highly literary or technical terms are avoided.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>CONIFERS</b> are trees such as pine, fir, cypress, and cedar that produce seeds inside of a hard, cone-shaped structure.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>CONNOTATION</b> involves the emotional attitude of a speaker (or writer) to an expression he uses, and the emotional response of the hearers (or readers). Connotations may be good or bad, strong or weak, and they are often described in such terms as “colloquial,” “taboo,” “vulgar,” “old-fashioned,” and “intimate.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>CONSONANTS</b> are speech sounds that are produced by blocking or restricting the passage of air as it comes from the lungs through the mouth. The written letters representing those sounds are also called consonants; for example, “b,” “d,” “f,” “k,” or “m” in English. Consonants were originally the only spoken sounds written in the Hebrew alphabet. Marks for <b>VOWELS</b> were added later above or below the consonants. See also <b>VOWELS</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>CONTEXT</b> is that which precedes and/or follows any part of a discourse. For example, the context of a word or phrase in Scripture would be the words and phrases associated with it in the sentence, paragraph, section, and even the entire book in which it occurs. The context of a term often affects its meaning, so that a word does not mean exactly the same thing in one context that it does in another.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>CULTURAL EQUIVALENT</b> is a kind of translation in which certain details from the culture of the source language are changed because they have no meaning or may even carry a wrong meaning for speakers of the receptor language. Cultural equivalent translation should be used only when absolutely necessary for conveying the intended meaning, and it may be important to add an explanatory note. See <b>CULTURE</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>CULTURE (CULTURAL)</b> is the combination of beliefs, values, social institutions, customs, and material objects (such as tools or ornaments) of any group of people. A culture is passed on from one generation to another but undergoes development or gradual change.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>DECIDUOUS</b> refers to trees like oaks that drop their leaves during a cold or dry season of the year and produce a new set in the following year. They stand in contrast to “evergreen” trees, which replace leaves as they die continuously throughout the year.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>DEFINITE ARTICLE</b>. See <b>ARTICLE</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>DESCRIPTIVE</b> is said of a word or phrase that characterizes or describes another term.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>DEUTEROCANON (DEUTEROCANONICAL)</b> is another term for what is referred to by some as the <b>APOCRYPHA</b>. These are writings that are included in the Greek <b>SEPTUAGINT</b> and the Old Testament of the Latin <b>VULGATE</b> but not in the <b>PROTOCANON</b> of the Hebrew canon.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>DOMESTICATE (DOMESTICATION)</b>, in translation, means to express a foreign word or concept in a way that makes it more like the receptor culture. For example, using “feet” and “inches” in expressing the measurements of Noah’s ark or Solomon’s Temple, rather than cubits, is “domestication.” See <b>FOREIGNIZE</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION</b> refers to a translation that tries to give the intended meaning of the source text in a natural and meaningful way so that it produces a response in today’s reader that is essentially equivalent to that of the original reader. <b>LITERAL</b> translations pay more attention to reproducing the forms found in the source text. For example, RSV follows the Hebrew wording of <s>01910402901000</s> and says: “they die and return to their dust.” CEV tries to give a dynamic equivalent translation: “they die and rot.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>EMENDATION (EMEND)</b> is a correction of a text. It is usually a change made by a scholar through a process of critical editing and not based directly on manuscript evidence.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>EMPHASIZE</b> means to give relative importance to an element in a discourse. Emphasis is conveyed by many different devices, depending on the language; for example, positioning of words, emphatic particles, intensifiers, or ideophones. In “Oh, that you had heeded my commandments!” (<s>02304801801000</s>, <a>NKJV</a>), the particle “Oh” marks this statement as emphatic.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>EQUIVALENCE (EQUIVALENT)</b> is a very close similarity in meaning or in form. See <b>DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION</b> and <b>FORMAL TRANSLATION</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>ETYMOLOGY</b> is the study of the derivation or history of words. While this can be a helpful study in many ways, it is much more important to know how a word is understood by its users in the actual context of the source language.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>EXEGESIS (EXEGETICAL)</b> is the process of determining the meaning of a text (or the result of this process), normally in terms of “who said what to whom under what circumstances and with what intent.” A correct exegesis is indispensable before a passage can be translated correctly.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>EXPLICIT</b> refers to meaning that is expressed overtly in the words of a discourse. This is in contrast to <b>IMPLICIT</b> information.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>FAMILY</b> in botany is a subdivision of an order in the classification of plants or trees. A family usually consists of several <b>GENERA</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>FIGURATIVE</b> expression involves the use of words in other than their <b>LITERAL</b> or ordinary sense, in order to bring out some aspect of meaning by comparison or association. For example, when the psalmist says “my cup overflows,” he is not saying his cup is too full. He is rather using a figure of speech to say that he is as content as someone who has been served a generous portion. <b>METAPHORS</b> and <b>SIMILES</b> are common figures of speech.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>FOREIGNIZE (FOREIGNIZATION)</b> refers to a general translation strategy that allows cultural items such as measurements, plants, animals, and technology to remain “foreign” to the reader instead of “domesticating” them by substituting cultural equivalents in the receptor language. When a translator converts “cubits” to “meters,” “wolf” to “hyena,” or “oak” to “iroko,” he or she is “domesticating” the text. Leaving “cubits,” “wolf,” or “oak” in a translation in West Africa is foreignizing the text. See <b>DOMESTICATE</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>FORMAL TRANSLATION</b> is a type of translation in which many features of the source text, especially the form of the discourse, have been literally reproduced in the translation. This approach often results in an unnatural style in the receptor language, or sometimes in the lack of any meaning at all. See <b>LITERAL</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE</b> is a type of translation that attempts to convey the same set of communicative functions as that of the original source text. Some important functions of communication are to convey information, to express or evoke emotions, to promote changes in thinking or behavior, or to maintain good interpersonal relations. See also <b>DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION</b>, which has a similar meaning.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>GENERAL</b> or <b>GENERIC</b>, refers to a general class or kind of object. It contrasts with PARTICULAR and SPECIFIC. For example, the word “food” is a generic term, while “fruit” is more specific. However, the word “fruit” is a generic term for the more specific word “orange.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>GENUS</b> (plural <b>GENERA</b>) is the usual major subdivision of a <b>FAMILY</b> or subfamily in the classification of organisms. A genus usually consists of more than one species.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>GLOSSARY</b> is a list, usually included at the back of a book, explaining or defining unusual words or expressions used in the text.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>GRAMMAR</b> refers to the rules governing the formation and arrangement of elements of meaning, words, and larger constructions in a language. If a sentence is grammatical, it follows the rules of normal speech, and sounds correct to a speaker of that language.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>GREEK</b> is the language in which the New Testament was written. It belongs to the Indo-European family of languages and was spoken in the area that is today called Greece. By the time of Christ, Greek was used by many of the people living in the eastern part of the Roman Empire, so that early Christians could speak and write to one another in Greek, even though they were born in different countries. By that time the entire Hebrew Old Testament had been translated into Greek, a version referred to as the <b>SEPTUAGINT</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>HEBREW</b> is the language in which the Old Testament was written. It belongs to the <b>SEMITIC</b> family of languages. By the time of Christ, many Jewish people no longer used Hebrew as their common language, but spoke <b>ARAMAIC</b> (a language related to Hebrew) or <b>GREEK</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>IMPLICIT</b>, or <b>IMPLIED</b>, refers to information that is conveyed by a text, but that is not expressed in words. The speaker assumes that the hearer understands the meaning. Often the meaning is clear from the <b>CONTEXT</b>. For example, when Hannah says in <s>00900200601000</s> “He brings down to Sheol and raises up,” the implied or implicit meaning is “raises up to life.” See <b>EXPLICIT</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>INTERPRETATION</b> is the process of determining the meaning of a text (or the result of this process), normally in terms of “who said what to whom under what circumstances and with what intent.” A correct interpretation is indispensable before a passage can be translated correctly.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>LINGUISTIC</b> refers to language, especially the formal structure of language.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>LITERAL</b> means the ordinary or primary meaning of a term or expression, in contrast with a <b>FIGURATIVE</b> meaning. A literal translation is one that is very close to the forms and word order of the source language; such a translation is frequently unnatural or awkward in the <b>RECEPTOR LANGUAGE</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>LOAN WORD</b> is a foreign word that is used in another language, resulting from the process of <b>BORROWING</b>. For example, “matador” is a Spanish word that has been <b>BORROWED</b> by English speakers for “bullfighter.”.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>MANUSCRIPTS</b> are books, documents, or letters written or copied by hand. Thousands of manuscript copies of various Old and New Testament books still exist, but none of the original manuscripts.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>MASORETIC TEXT</b> is the form of the text of the Hebrew Old Testament established by Hebrew scholars around the eighth and ninth centuries A.D.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>MASTIC</b> is the gum, resin, or sap that is produced by a tree when the inner bark is cut, particularly the gum from the lentisk or pistachio tree, which when it dries in lumps, it is valuable for incense.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>METAPHOR</b> is likening one object, event, or state (the “topic”) to another (the “image”) to which it is not directly or closely related in meaning. For example, when a person says “I am a worm,” he is describing his state as being lowly, miserable, or of no value. Biblical metaphors are often difficult to understand because the basis for the comparison is not always stated, as in the line “The LORD is my rock” (<s>01901800201000</s>). At other times either the image or the basis of comparison is unfamiliar or used differently in the receptor language. For example, when the psalmist says “He remembers that we are dust” (<s>01910301401000</s>), he is not referring to the dirt or dust on our bodies. Metaphors are the most commonly used figures of speech and are often so subtle that a speaker or writer is not conscious of the fact that he or she is using figurative language. See <b>SIMILE</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>METONYM (METONYMIC)</b> is a figure of speech in which a part of an object is used to indicate the entire object (for example, “one hundred head” means “one hundred cows”), or in which an object stands for another object to which it is related (for example, “the crown” can refer to the king or even the entire royal government).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>MODIFY</b> is to directly affect the meaning of another part of the sentence, as when an adjective modifies a noun or an adverb modifies a verb.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>NEGEV</b> refers to the desert area in the southern part of the Holy Land.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>NONFIGURATIVE</b> involves the use of words in their literal or ordinary sense. See <b>FIGURATIVE</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>NOUN</b> is a word that names a person, place, thing, quality, action or idea.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>OVATE</b> refers to a leaf in the shape of an egg.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>PARABLE</b> is a short story designed to illustrate or teach some truth, religious principle, or moral lesson. Jesus often used parables to illustrate truths concerning the kingdom of God (for example, the parable of the mustard seed in <s>04100403001000 04100403101000 04100403201000</s>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>PARALLEL (PARALLELISM)</b> generally refers to some similarity in the content and/or form of two parts of a construction; for example, “Hear this, all peoples! Give ear, all inhabitants of the world.” The structures that correspond to each other in the two statements are said to be parallel. <b>PARALLEL PASSAGES</b> are two or more portions of biblical text that resemble each other, often by using a series of words that are identical. For example, the Lord’s Prayer as recorded in <s>04000600901000 04000601001000 04000601101000 04000601201000 04000601301000</s> has as its parallel <s>04201100201000 04201100301000 04201100401000</s>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>PARTICULAR</b> is the opposite of <b>GENERAL</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>PASSAGE</b> is the text of Scripture in a specific location. It is usually thought of as comprising more than one verse, but it can be a single verse or part of a verse.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>PENTATEUCH</b> refers to the first five books of the Bible, sometimes called “the Torah,” “the Law,” or “the Books of Moses.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>PHRASE</b> is a dependent grammatical construction of two or more words, but less than a complete clause or a sentence. A phrase is usually given a name according to its main word, such as that of a noun phrase, verb phrase, or prepositional phrase. For example, “a purple coat” is a noun phrase, “behind the house” is a prepositional phrase, and “carried a heavy load” is a verb phrase.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>PINNATE</b> refers to trees or plants that have leaflets arranged on both sides of a stem, sometimes opposite each other, sometimes alternating. Such leaflets are part of what is called a “compound” leaf such as you will find on a frankincense tree.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>PLURAL</b> refers to the form of a word that indicates more than one. See <b>SINGULAR</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>POETRY (POETIC)</b> refers to a literary genre that differs from everyday speech and from <b>PROSE</b> because of its rhythmic and heightened style. Poets use special language to create a mood or image to be shared with the hearer or reader. Each language has special stylistic devices such as figurative language, word order variation, wordplay, repetition or rhyming that are especially frequent in poetry (compare <s>00700400001000</s> and <s>00700500001000</s>). The boundary between beautiful, artistic prose and poetry is sometimes difficult to determine, but speakers of a language can usually distinguish poetry from ordinary speech. Poetry is usually written or spoken in measured or balanced lines, while prose is not.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>PREFIX</b> is a part of a word that cannot stand alone and that is positioned at the beginning of the word to which it belongs; for example, “im-possible” or “re-structure.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>PROSE</b> is the ordinary form of spoken or written language, without a special style and structure such as elaborate imagery, meter, and rhythm that are often characteristic of <b>POETRY</b>. However, literary prose may share some of the features of poetry, such as figures of speech, wordplay, repetition, or even parallelism.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>PROTOCANON</b> includes the Hebrew books of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament. These books are commonly accepted as canonical by both Protestants and Roman Catholics.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>QUALIFY</b> is to limit the meaning of a term by means of another term. For example, in “old man,” the term “old” qualifies the term “man.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>READ (READING)</b> refers to the wording of a particular manuscript for a passage. Two manuscripts may have different wordings in the same passage, or two versions may have two different meanings. For example, in <s>00900102401000</s> the Hebrew text says “three bulls,” but the Greek and Syriac versions say “a three-year-old bull.” These are different readings. See also <b>TEXT</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>RECEPTOR</b> is the person(s) receiving a message. The <b>RECEPTOR LANGUAGE</b> is the language into which a translation is made. For example, in a translation from Hebrew into German, Hebrew is the source language and German is the receptor language.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>REDUNDANT</b> describes anything that is entirely predictable from the context. For example, in “John, he did it,” the pronoun “he” is redundant. A feature may be redundant and yet may be important to retain in certain languages, perhaps for stylistic or grammatical reasons.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>RENDER</b> means to translate or express in a language different from the original.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>RENDERING</b> is the manner in which a specific passage is translated from one language to another.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>RESTRUCTURE</b> is to rearrange the various components of a sentence or other unit of discourse in the translation process.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>RHETORICAL</b> refers to forms of speech that are employed to highlight or make more attractive some aspect of a discourse. A <b>RHETORICAL QUESTION</b>, for example, is not a request for information but is usually a way of making an emphatic statement.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>ROOT</b> refers to the smallest element of a word, from which other words may be derived. For example, “friend” is the root of “friendliness.” In Hebrew most roots are made up of three consonants, and many words are formed on the basis of this root. For example, the root b-r-k is the basis for the noun “blessing,” the adjective “blessed,” and the verb “to bless.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>SEMANTIC</b> refers to meaning. Semantics is the study of the meaning of language forms. Semantic categories (or classes) group words according to their meaning (objects, events, abstracts, etc.) in contrast to grammatical categories (nouns, verbs, etc.) A <b>SEMANTIC DOMAIN</b> is a definable area of experience that is referred to by a set of words whose meanings are in some way related. For example, kinship terms constitute a semantic domain. Similarly, the color terms of a language may be said to form a semantic domain.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>Semitic</b> refers to a family of languages that includes <b>Hebrew</b>, <b>Aramaic</b>, and Arabic.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>SENTENCE</b> is a grammatical construction composed of one or more clauses and capable of standing alone..</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>SEPTUAGINT</b> is a translation of the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek, begun some two hundred years before Christ. It is often abbreviated as <a>LXX</a>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>SIMILE</b> (pronounced SIM-i-lee) is a figure of speech that describes one event or object (the “topic”) by comparing it to another event or object (the “image”). Similes always use words of comparison such as “like” or “as.” “Your lips [the topic] are like a scarlet thread [the image]” is a simile from <s>02200400301000</s>. Similes differ from <b>METAPHORS</b> in that metaphors do not mark the image with words that indicate comparison. See <b>METAPHOR</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>SINGULAR</b> refers to the form of a word that indicates one thing or person, in contrast to PLURAL, which indicates more than one.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>SPECIFIC</b> refers to the opposite of <b>GENERIC</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>STAMENS</b> are long thin parts of the inside of a flower that carry pollen.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>STRUCTURE</b> is the systematic arrangement of the elements of language, including the ways in which words combine into phrases, phrases into clauses, clauses into sentences, and sentences into larger units of discourse. This process can be compared to constructing a building so structures are often spoken of as constructions. To separate and rearrange the various components of a sentence or some other unit of discourse in the translation process is to <b>RESTRUCTURE</b> it.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>SUFFIX</b> is a letter or one or more syllables added to the end of a word, to modify the meaning in some manner. For example, “-s” suffixed to “tree” changes the word from singular to plural, “trees,” while “-ing” suffixed to “sing” changes the verb to a participle, “singing.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>SYMBOL (SYMBOLIC)</b> is a form, whether linguistic or nonlinguistic, which is arbitrarily and conventionally associated with a particular meaning. For example, the word “cross” is a linguistic symbol, referring to a particular object. Similarly, within the Christian tradition, the cross as an object is a symbol for the death of Jesus.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>SYNONYMS</b> are words that are different in form but similar in meaning, such as “boy” and “lad.” Expressions that have essentially the same meaning are said to be <b>SYNONYMOUS</b>. However, no two words are completely synonymous.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>SYNTAX</b> is the selection and arrangement of words in phrases, clauses, and sentences.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>SYRIAC</b> is the name of a <b>SEMITIC</b> language, a part of the <b>ARAMAIC</b> family, used in Western Asia, into which the Bible was translated at a very early date (the <b>Syriac version</b>).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>TARGUM</b> is an Aramaic translation or paraphrase of a section of the ancient Hebrew Scriptures.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>TEXT (TEXTUAL)</b> refers to the various Biblical manuscripts. A textual <b>READING</b> is the form in which words occur in a particular manuscript (or group of manuscripts), especially where it differs from others. Textual evidence is any evidence from manuscripts that may support a particular reading. <b>TEXTUAL PROBLEMS</b> arise when manuscripts contain different readings. These <b>TEXTUAL VARIATIONS</b> are readings of the same passage that differ in one or more details. An <b>EMENDATION</b> is a scholar’s reconstruction of what the ancient text may have been, even though no manuscript exists today to support that reconstruction. See also MANUSCRIPTS.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>TRANSLATION</b> is the transfer of a message in a source language text into another language, the <b>RECEPTOR LANGUAGE</b>. A good translation aims at giving the closest natural equivalent in the receptor language in terms of meaning (content and function) and, if possible, also form (style and structure).</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>TRANSLITERATE (TRANSLITERATION)</b> is to represent in the <b>RECEPTOR LANGUAGE</b> the approximate sounds or letters of words occurring in the source language. Transliterating is different from <b>TRANSLATING</b>. For example, “Amen” in Hebrew may be transliterated in one language as “amin,” or it may be translated as “So be it.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>VERBS</b> are a grammatical class of words that express existence, action, state, or occurrence, such as “be,” “run,” “become,” or “think.” In some languages ideas expressed by adjectives in English may be better expressed by verbs; for example, “to be hot” or “to be angry.”</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>VOWELS</b> are speech sounds of the vocal cords, produced by unobstructed air passing from the lungs though the mouth. The written letters representing those sounds are also called vowels; for example, “a,” “i,” or “u,” which are the most common vowels found in the world’s languages. In Hebrew vowels were originally not written, but they were added later as small marks (called vowel points) written under or above the <b>CONSONANTS</b>. See also <b>CONSONANTS</b>.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph><b>VERSIONS</b> are different translations of the same original document. Among ancient versions of the Bible are the Greek Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Ethiopic. <a>RSV</a> and <a>GNB</a> are modern versions in English.</Paragraph>
          </Paragraphs>
          <Paragraphs>
            <Paragraph><b>VULGATE</b> is the Latin version of the Bible translated and/or edited originally by Saint Jerome near the end of the fourth century A.D. It has been traditionally the official version of the Roman Catholic Church.</Paragraph>
